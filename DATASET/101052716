  kinda...i dont live in orlando anymore so I wouldnt be able to go down there in time.
  argh wont be able to make it :(
  DLC is coming to Orlando?!?!
  can you send me the sleeves? I wanna be cool...
 Argh. Stop publishing horrible photos of the 'famous' members of bands.
  any idea on a recent kings of leon show? Release? soundboard?
  Awww you shoulda let me know you were there :(
 finally got my  album in the mail! woohoo!
  hmm I might have to try the 2x extender. Love your work. Keep it up!
  its the number 1 song on the rock charts!
  what lens do you use for your soundboard shoots?
 Wooooo  finally have a  center!!
 Adele is a musical genius. 
 The Mavericks will forever be honorary 
  is 12 stones touring anytime soon??
 Any photographers or writers looking for work in the Gulf Coast?!
  LR all the way for concert pics...
  woot! send ASAP cuz im hungryyyyyy
  both please!
  seriously keri? all your cool points have been taken away now.
  send the leftovers my way
 If you decide to stand right next to the stage in a wide pit, don't stick your cam up and take random shots, hoping to get something.....
  fair enough haha. i might have to make a trip down for that show.
  but the press release already went out! :P
  good luck getting photos of him :(
  it was pretty awesome and they trashed cee lo the whole time.
 Who the hell is cee lo's tour manager??? He's pulling another coachella at hangout.....
  special request for hangout fest....secret country and excuses!
  knew youd come crawling back....
  thats the gist of dubstep. lots of wommmmmp.
  listen to korns new song. Its a version of electronic/techno music
 Go away, Dubstep. Please for all that is right with humanity.
 The race card is pulled far too often.....I'm lookin at you Chris Johnson...
  Not only does it look delish....I had a realization of where you get your 'can't say no' demeanor.
  youre not going to hangout?!
  im going to make a  account.
 wooooooo hangout fest is a go!
  gonna have to cross my fingers....
  I still havent heard anything back from those guys....did they send you an email?
  thanks for the ff!
  orly?
   singing Angel's Son with  EPIC!
 wow cant wait to see the  at hangout fest
 Being vegan/vegetarian doesn't make you healthy.....you're conscience food decisions and lack of processed foods does. 
  overnight fedex plz and thks
  I wanna be on a train from NY to DC :( that sounds fun.
 Sigh....
 Really liking this new Asking Alexandria album. Hope I get to see them on Warped Tour this year...
  Eh I tried. Thats the best I can do for you.
  That's the only song I can stand. And thats pushing it..
  Sorry dude Ive tried to listen to them countless times. Nothing tickles my fancy.
 Am I the only one who finds Clutch to be absolutely horrible?
 Who should be my 1000th follow?!
  Send out an APB. I need a (somewhat) recent release from the Foo Fighters....wanna see what I am up against.
  oh I agree. I was wondering why that's the term of choice.
 Why is it that any time someone meets someone famous they are always 'down to earth'?
 So much hate for the new Seether song....its pretty fantastic if you ask me...

  good. I hope we can move on from this like civilized people.
  hey now! You don't knowwwwww me!
  yea that's all the faster my brain works.
  Their music will clog my ears, thus my mind wont be open any more.
  I beg to differ. My ears don't need to bleed.
  My opinion of you has diminished completely.
 the new  single kicks ass! missed them.
  you should've given them the REAL real world test.....all red lighting with no spot lights....haha
  any photos from the show?!
 Remind me not to go out of my way to see Seether live again until they get a 2nd guitarist. Its like going to a Chevelle show, again.
 Reliving memories of stone sour weekend. They are kicking some serious ass.  
  you're at rockfest?!
 Theory played a new song....get ready for more nickelback jr!
 Wow  is really good live. 
  agreed. Its gonna take a while.
  killed it! Why aren't these guys huge yet?!
 Rise and Grind, Its  time!
  thanks for the ff :)
  Haha! I think the term 'pro' is used very loosely by some of these people.
   what is toryn doing these days?
  I'm gonna have to cancel our agreement then. This just isn't working out. Its not me, its you.
  There's a club?! What the hell did I get into?
  I feel unneeded and used now :(
  THATS why you followed me isn't it?!
  My opinion is indeed a fact.
  It happened at some point tonight :P
  but it says i have 679 :(
 I'm convinced Blackbird by Alter Bridge is the greatest song ever created.
   hmmm I better get on that LOL
  haha I havent figured out my plans yet. it would be a 10 hour drive for me :(
   you two need to man up and make sure you are in charlotte may 7th.
   Ok deal. I'll bring apple juice and a sippy cup for her.
   I'm trusting you on this one. DONT be wrong. Angry pirates cause world wars.
   PSST KT: I don't know if we can trust someone who is allergic to rum. Its against all that is right.
   everyone knows that witches are posers...
   so lets me get this straight...KT is a ninja, Im a pirate....and sarah's a wizard?
 halibut with a honey/balsamic reduction glaze.....YUMMMMM
   you ninja us in....ill bring the rum and the wenches for the party. Do we have an accord?
   kristin has the hook ups.....remember?
   you both know carolina rebellion is the place to be...
 Dear Music Photographers, taking average (at best) photos and applying drastic effects to them in photoshop does not make you a 'pro'.
  heard anything back from the rockfest folks?
  gonna be a blast! I'm sure it helps that seether, stone sour and 3 doors down will be there too...
 cant wait to see    and  this weekend!
  so the truth comes out...you claim to be a ninja yet pirates pull at your heart strings. TSK TSK TSK
  damn girl! get it! I am planning on going to ROTR this year.
  traveling for any big festivals this year?!
  All That Remains - The Fall of Ideals......I forgot how great this album is.
   Im not scared of either of you. In fact, you should both be deathly afraid of me.
   I don't agree with that statement.
   listen here young'n.....you have so much to learn.
  I thought we went over this already. I am not scared of you.
  youre a month older than me! nana nana booboo
  you're getting old!! when is your bday?
  *jots another note in black book*
  
  mediocre.
  who did the band get to replace you? :(
 I really underestimated how good Alter Bridge's ABIII was last year....
 so its official....I will be covering the southeastern US for  magazine! Lots of great shows and festivals coming up!
  fatter glen davis? isn't he 300 pounds? lol
  I miss troy already :(
  I sure hope so!
  I had mixed feelings at first. I feel like this song was something they went back and made to appease the record label...
 The new seether song is really growing on me.....
  name one activity that wouldn't be more fun with rum and a parrot....
  sounds to me like you need an assistant to help you....a fluffer if you will...
  
  no...thus you trying to hide. Fight to the death is the only way to resolve this. 
  I think you pretty much have me figured out now. 
  im part pirate. treasure hunts are kinda my thing...
  its on like donkey kong. watch your back...
  if you saw it i would have to kill you.
  *jots down in black book*
  usually in april.
 Still can't decide between rock on the range, carolina rebellion and hangout fest....or 2 of them?
  yea! all is well. just trying to catch up on a lot of stuff haha.
  eh mostly life related things. havent had much time for the photography thing lately.
  hey! been good. Just catching up on alot of stuff.
  Understatement of the year, good sir.
 There are very few bands that I try to push onto people but these two are must-listens!  (alt rock) and  (hard rock)
    soooooo goood.
   sounds like a pretty epic plan to me ladies....
   I agree. they actually have the same US publicist as sevendust
  Andy Samberg as you dickie V! 
   that song is pretty freakin phenominal.....they need to come to the US....NOW.
  This makes me angry. I want to punch babies.
  you mean to tell me theyve NEVER toured here?! They have an awesome publicist here too....
 Seriously, how are  not HUGE in the US? I am dumbfounded.
 Saliva needs to stop making music. Now.
  Yes. At least that's what I have been told.....multiple times...
  what happens if i know how to use a shovel with my feet?
  oh my....i think you got me there....
  (reaches for shovel)
  droid >>>>>>> iphone. Droid has words with friends too :)
  time to upgrade to the big leagues!
  words with friends is better!
 Vegas baby!
  Karnivool rarely comes here and they have a bigger following....if either of them comes to the usa, id travel pretty far....
  No,  !!!!!
  say what?! i love those guys. Are they coming to the US too?!
  I had a fairly famous producer/musician ask me why i was shooting if I wasnt f*king the band and wasnt trying to get into it
  I'm convinced they are the reason it is so hard to make it as a concert photographer....that and FWC.
  touche. I've been noticing shit like this alot lately...
  Seether is meh live without him :(. Deeply disappointed with this news.
  I call BS....
  Florence looks about 35 from the pics I took of her...
  the only time I shot at the forum was for a winter jam show and there was a catwalk and a slim pit.
  nonono i dont need it. Im just worried about an average joe hogging all the space! I'll be getting my pass legitimately lol
   I don't know how i feel about this. Rockfest is part of this tour...
 finally get to see  live in april! woot!
 anyone have a copy of an old foo fighters photo release? I'd like to see what I am up against for Hangout Fest....
 Sheen fired by the producers of Two and a Half Men 
 Charlie Sheen, you still have a little 'win' left under your nose.  
  they just want the goodies that come with it.
  there are certain people ive seen on here recently who dont give a damn about the bands they promote....
 You know what grinds my gears? People promoting bands ONLY for the good it can bring to themselves....not to the band.
 This is probably the only time a Bluejacket has ever trended on twitter.....its about time!! 
 sad to see klesla go but we definitely needed some help at the wing, so does this mean we are ALSO getting Liles from COL?! 
  sure....for 13 year olds....
  Most are ignorant to the world of photography and copyright laws in general and have no interest in learning about them.
  send her a bill :P
  Not a fan of his music at all but I respect that he's good at what he does. Hating him is the popular thing to do right now.
  as much as i hate the aura surrounding bieber, the kid can sing and he takes everything in stride.
  PFFT! his older stuff was better! My Way WOOT!

  btw, did you get to shoot ozzy?
  hmm i wonder if its who i think it is....if so, i am quite disappointed.

  indeed. He lives in rockville center.

  photos from deluna fest are posted! 
  thx for the add....love your work.
 Adding a horrible quality photo of a well known person to your portfolio just to show you shot a picture of them irritates me.
  I want one....
  you know panic at the disco has an album coming out the same day as yours now....and its also named vices and virtues...
  you sir are beyond correct.
 I can't stop listening to this song.... 
  Very cool. I will be seeing them soon with Jonathan Tyler and the Northern Lights. This is quite the good news...
  I've had a couple occasions where the artist didn't want photos from the pit because of a dress/skirt. The Submarines for ex.
  did grace potter's management not give you any shit because of the dress she was wearing?
 ROAD HOUSE.
  that's what I had heard too....i figured I would try anyways.
  still concert photos for now...
  nice! I even checked with his MSO rep and they said no :(...then again I don't shoot for a big pub :(

   Maybe! I was contemplating a festival in ohio the same weekend but a very similar lineup was announced for another show
 REEEEMIXXXXXX! now that Carolina Rebellion has been announced....maybe now I can go to Hangout Fest too!
  are you guys still planning on having a May festival?
  weird...anyone i know whose done interviews at the show is usually given a pass/ticket for the show.
  just tell them you will be at the show to interview them ;)
  well there's your problem! they only get tickets because they 'have' to be in the show to do their 'work'
  I think we may have to move the party to charlotte....although i may be attending both.
  do you do the interviews AT the shows?
  everyone knows someone in the industry....
  TL meetup you say? I'm in.
  i would have to agree..
  and its all in one day!

   muahahahah whats done is done...and whats lost is lost....
   you missed most of it! ask sarah for the rest of the deets :D
  sigh....you left out that part. you are sending mixed signals to the dude. you need to straight up tell him what you want.
  didn't i say platonic earlier?! or is this the dude who stole your undergarments?!
  i dont get what you want then LOL
  some guys are physically unable to do the platonic thing.... :-/

  oh a youngin eh? And how did you drink this weekend? Hmmm???!
  no drinking at rotr? Say what?
   touche. Wish I had thought of that one....
   back seat of a truck?! you must have had a hell of a night...
   like i said before....practice before ROTR. Bring your A game!
  how is it possible to tweet about missing items but not the acts that caused such misplacement?!
  BOW CHICA WAH WAH GET SOME!!!!! 
  LOL see thats what ive been trying to get at but she still seems to be in denial
  ahhh the ole cant splain it over the interwebz trick eh....
  things just aren't adding up ma'am. if the police were interrogating you, you would be screwed.
  why did you have undergarments in your pocket?!?!
  sigh....you're changing your story now...
  ok seriously....how do you lose stuff then?!
  shouldn't you have played that last night?
  
  you are watching what? with who?
 Good game! Well done this year with an average team and lots of injuries.
  :( meh. I imagine it would be extremely easy to hitchhike in Texas with no underwear on though...
  And here I thought losing undergarments was a good thing...
 woohoo just heard new fire by  during the OSU basketball game!!
  i guess its no worse than me going to ohio for ROTR every year from FL....but I dont drive!
  how does that make it any better?! lol
  drove to philly from texas?! you crazy gurl!
  philly show? aren't you from texas?!
 ahhh i don't know which  pics to choose...
   sounds to me like BOTH of you need to practice quite a bit before ROTR.
  handle your liquor better? didn't you lose undergarments last night? 
  Jose will be making a huge appearance at ROTR if you show up with that do.
  how does one mess up a shaved head in a helmet?
   she just needs to learn how to handle her liquor...not a body guard.
  did you end up playing hockey or roller derby on NYE?! GEEZ!
  a helmet and kneepads?!
  how does one lose said undergarments then?!
  MUAHAHAHHAHAHAH
  ooooo....so it was a singer who took your undergarments?!
  *takes notes* I hope they sell Jose at ROTR...
  what the hell did you do last night?!
  you should get his buddies Jack and Jose to follow you too!
 7.
  eh i shot my pics and left....wasnt even close to worth it.
 Wow disturbed is so bad live. Draiman seriously looks like a midget and the whole band looks bored.
 morgan rose filling in for korn at tonight's show? yes, please!
  That's dirty, ma'am.
  ooorrrrrr what?! I ain't scurred of you!
  surrrrrrreeeeeeeeee. i believe that as much as i believe you will half shave your hair.
  its friday come on! are you this lame at concerts?!
  or.....HAIR enough!!! bahaha...sorry ive been drinking and I find that funny right now.
  hair are big deals. especially if drinks are on the line...
  send pics as soon as it happens. i owe you a drink if you actually do it.
  did you cut your hair yet? You should atleast try out the half buzz before rotr....
  i always knew you were a steelers fan at heart...
 Download the track  from  & support the Black & Yellow! Go Steelers!! 
  well this time it happens to be for the MAAW tour....but this is a recurring theme ALL the time.
  its annoying as hell!
  you never emailed me!!
   So BOTH of you will soon be seen with this haircut? Do we have an accord?
  MUCHO CALIENTE!    I expect that do and nothing less.
  :( the 7dust lady was a big help! Thanks again!
 Why are PR companies and band management so hard to deal with?!?! ARGH!

  fair enough haha. i might have to make a trip down for that show.
  but the press release already went out! :P
  good luck getting photos of him :(
  it was pretty awesome and they trashed cee lo the whole time.
 Who the hell is cee lo's tour manager??? He's pulling another coachella at hangout.....

 Who should be my 1000th follow?!
  Send out an APB. I need a (somewhat) recent release from the Foo Fighters....wanna see what I am up against.
  oh I agree. I was wondering why that's the term of choice.
 Why is it that any time someone meets someone famous they are always 'down to earth'?
 So much hate for the new Seether song....its pretty fantastic if you ask me...

   what is toryn doing these days?
  I'm gonna have to cancel our agreement then. This just isn't working out. Its not me, its you.
  There's a club?! What the hell did I get into?
  I feel unneeded and used now :(
  THATS why you followed me isn't it?!
  My opinion is indeed a fact.
  It happened at some point tonight :P
  but it says i have 679 :(
 I'm convinced Blackbird by Alter Bridge is the greatest song ever created.
   hmmm I better get on that LOL
  haha I havent figured out my plans yet. it would be a 10 hour drive for me :(
   you two need to man up and make sure you are in charlotte may 7th.
   Ok deal. I'll bring apple juice and a sippy cup for her.
   I'm trusting you on this one. DONT be wrong. Angry pirates cause world wars.
   PSST KT: I don't know if we can trust someone who is allergic to rum. Its against all that is right.
   everyone knows that witches are posers...
   so lets me get this straight...KT is a ninja, Im a pirate....and sarah's a wizard?
 halibut with a honey/balsamic reduction glaze.....YUMMMMM
   you ninja us in....ill bring the rum and the wenches for the party. Do we have an accord?
   kristin has the hook ups.....remember?
   you both know carolina rebellion is the place to be...
 Dear Music Photographers, taking average (at best) photos and applying drastic effects to them in photoshop does not make you a 'pro'.
  heard anything back from the rockfest folks?
  gonna be a blast! I'm sure it helps that seether, stone sour and 3 doors down will be there too...
 cant wait to see    and  this weekend!
  so the truth comes out...you claim to be a ninja yet pirates pull at your heart strings. TSK TSK TSK
  damn girl! get it! I am planning on going to ROTR this year.
  traveling for any big festivals this year?!
  All That Remains - The Fall of Ideals......I forgot how great this album is.
   Im not scared of either of you. In fact, you should both be deathly afraid of me.
   I don't agree with that statement.
   listen here young'n.....you have so much to learn.
  I thought we went over this already. I am not scared of you.
  youre a month older than me! nana nana booboo
  you're getting old!! when is your bday?
  *jots another note in black book*
  
  mediocre.
  who did the band get to replace you? :(
 I really underestimated how good Alter Bridge's ABIII was last year....
 so its official....I will be covering the southeastern US for  magazine! Lots of great shows and festivals coming up!
  fatter glen davis? isn't he 300 pounds? lol
  I miss troy already :(
  I sure hope so!
  I had mixed feelings at first. I feel like this song was something they went back and made to appease the record label...
 The new seether song is really growing on me.....
  name one activity that wouldn't be more fun with rum and a parrot....
  sounds to me like you need an assistant to help you....a fluffer if you will...
  
  no...thus you trying to hide. Fight to the death is the only way to resolve this. 
  I think you pretty much have me figured out now. 
  im part pirate. treasure hunts are kinda my thing...
  its on like donkey kong. watch your back...
  if you saw it i would have to kill you.
  *jots down in black book*
  usually in april.
 Still can't decide between rock on the range, carolina rebellion and hangout fest....or 2 of them?
  yea! all is well. just trying to catch up on a lot of stuff haha.
  eh mostly life related things. havent had much time for the photography thing lately.
  hey! been good. Just catching up on alot of stuff.
  Understatement of the year, good sir.
 There are very few bands that I try to push onto people but these two are must-listens!  (alt rock) and  (hard rock)
    soooooo goood.
   sounds like a pretty epic plan to me ladies....
   I agree. they actually have the same US publicist as sevendust
  Andy Samberg as you dickie V! 
   that song is pretty freakin phenominal.....they need to come to the US....NOW.
  This makes me angry. I want to punch babies.
  you mean to tell me theyve NEVER toured here?! They have an awesome publicist here too....
 Seriously, how are  not HUGE in the US? I am dumbfounded.
 Saliva needs to stop making music. Now.
  Yes. At least that's what I have been told.....multiple times...
  what happens if i know how to use a shovel with my feet?
  oh my....i think you got me there....
  (reaches for shovel)
  droid >>>>>>> iphone. Droid has words with friends too :)
  time to upgrade to the big leagues!
  words with friends is better!
 Vegas baby!
  Karnivool rarely comes here and they have a bigger following....if either of them comes to the usa, id travel pretty far....
  No,  !!!!!
  say what?! i love those guys. Are they coming to the US too?!
  I had a fairly famous producer/musician ask me why i was shooting if I wasnt f*king the band and wasnt trying to get into it
  I'm convinced they are the reason it is so hard to make it as a concert photographer....that and FWC.
  touche. I've been noticing shit like this alot lately...
  Seether is meh live without him :(. Deeply disappointed with this news.
  I call BS....
  Florence looks about 35 from the pics I took of her...
  the only time I shot at the forum was for a winter jam show and there was a catwalk and a slim pit.
  nonono i dont need it. Im just worried about an average joe hogging all the space! I'll be getting my pass legitimately lol
   I don't know how i feel about this. Rockfest is part of this tour...
 finally get to see  live in april! woot!
 anyone have a copy of an old foo fighters photo release? I'd like to see what I am up against for Hangout Fest....
 Sheen fired by the producers of Two and a Half Men 
 Charlie Sheen, you still have a little 'win' left under your nose.  
  they just want the goodies that come with it.
  there are certain people ive seen on here recently who dont give a damn about the bands they promote....
 You know what grinds my gears? People promoting bands ONLY for the good it can bring to themselves....not to the band.
 This is probably the only time a Bluejacket has ever trended on twitter.....its about time!! 
 sad to see klesla go but we definitely needed some help at the wing, so does this mean we are ALSO getting Liles from COL?! 
  sure....for 13 year olds....
  Most are ignorant to the world of photography and copyright laws in general and have no interest in learning about them.
  send her a bill :P
  Not a fan of his music at all but I respect that he's good at what he does. Hating him is the popular thing to do right now.
  as much as i hate the aura surrounding bieber, the kid can sing and he takes everything in stride.
  PFFT! his older stuff was better! My Way WOOT!
  Usher - You Make Me Wanna

 hangout fest is where its at.....
  thanks for the follow. love your stuff in nural. what ever happened to you guys?! :(
  surrrrrreeee rub it in everyone's faces......LOL
  btw, did you get to shoot ozzy?
  hmm i wonder if its who i think it is....if so, i am quite disappointed.

  did I miss something on that FB post? It seems like there is a person missing from the convo.
  indeed. He lives in rockville center.
  i had no idea you lived on LI....my bro lives there
  vince did that 10 years ago though.....
 That griffin dunk was dumb. I hope mcgee wins.

  why would she do such a thing?!
  4GB?! I don't know what I would do with that little amount of memory....
  photos from deluna fest are posted! 
  thx for the add....love your work.
 Adding a horrible quality photo of a well known person to your portfolio just to show you shot a picture of them irritates me.
  I want one....
  you know panic at the disco has an album coming out the same day as yours now....and its also named vices and virtues...
  you sir are beyond correct.
 I can't stop listening to this song.... 
  Very cool. I will be seeing them soon with Jonathan Tyler and the Northern Lights. This is quite the good news...
  I've had a couple occasions where the artist didn't want photos from the pit because of a dress/skirt. The Submarines for ex.
  did grace potter's management not give you any shit because of the dress she was wearing?
 ROAD HOUSE.
  that's what I had heard too....i figured I would try anyways.
  still concert photos for now...
  nice! I even checked with his MSO rep and they said no :(...then again I don't shoot for a big pub :(
  new publication maybe :)
  how the hell did you get that radko?! I'm still waiting to hear about slash...
 expanding my photographic horizons in the near future...
  not a fan of either one. Are you tiring of the current one?
  dont you do it....DONT YOU DO IT!
  do it. that is a once in a lifetime chance right there...
 I wish I would've marketed a robe that was mean't to be worn backwards....
  I thought you were past that phase!!

 going through some images of someone who is considered an 'elite' concert photog......not impressed.
   Maybe! I was contemplating a festival in ohio the same weekend but a very similar lineup was announced for another show
 REEEEMIXXXXXX! now that Carolina Rebellion has been announced....maybe now I can go to Hangout Fest too!
  are you guys still planning on having a May festival?
  weird...anyone i know whose done interviews at the show is usually given a pass/ticket for the show.
  just tell them you will be at the show to interview them ;)
  well there's your problem! they only get tickets because they 'have' to be in the show to do their 'work'
  I think we may have to move the party to charlotte....although i may be attending both.
  do you do the interviews AT the shows?
  everyone knows someone in the industry....
  TL meetup you say? I'm in.
  i would have to agree..
  and its all in one day!
  www.carolinarebellion.com
 I might be making a trip to charlotte on may 7th....holy crap
  the industry term for those individuals is FWC...fans with credentials.

   muahahahah whats done is done...and whats lost is lost....
   you missed most of it! ask sarah for the rest of the deets :D
  sigh....you left out that part. you are sending mixed signals to the dude. you need to straight up tell him what you want.
  didn't i say platonic earlier?! or is this the dude who stole your undergarments?!
  i dont get what you want then LOL
  some guys are physically unable to do the platonic thing.... :-/

  BOW CHICA WAH WAH GET SOME!!!!! 
  LOL see thats what ive been trying to get at but she still seems to be in denial
  ahhh the ole cant splain it over the interwebz trick eh....
  things just aren't adding up ma'am. if the police were interrogating you, you would be screwed.
  why did you have undergarments in your pocket?!?!
  sigh....you're changing your story now...
  ok seriously....how do you lose stuff then?!
  shouldn't you have played that last night?
  
  you are watching what? with who?
 Good game! Well done this year with an average team and lots of injuries.
  :( meh. I imagine it would be extremely easy to hitchhike in Texas with no underwear on though...
  And here I thought losing undergarments was a good thing...
 woohoo just heard new fire by  during the OSU basketball game!!
  i guess its no worse than me going to ohio for ROTR every year from FL....but I dont drive!
  how does that make it any better?! lol
  drove to philly from texas?! you crazy gurl!
  philly show? aren't you from texas?!
 ahhh i don't know which  pics to choose...
   sounds to me like BOTH of you need to practice quite a bit before ROTR.
  handle your liquor better? didn't you lose undergarments last night? 
  Jose will be making a huge appearance at ROTR if you show up with that do.
  how does one mess up a shaved head in a helmet?
   she just needs to learn how to handle her liquor...not a body guard.
  did you end up playing hockey or roller derby on NYE?! GEEZ!
  a helmet and kneepads?!
  how does one lose said undergarments then?!
  MUAHAHAHHAHAHAH
  ooooo....so it was a singer who took your undergarments?!
  *takes notes* I hope they sell Jose at ROTR...
  what the hell did you do last night?!
  you should get his buddies Jack and Jose to follow you too!
 7.
  eh i shot my pics and left....wasnt even close to worth it.
 Wow disturbed is so bad live. Draiman seriously looks like a midget and the whole band looks bored.

  That's dirty, ma'am.

  hair are big deals. especially if drinks are on the line...
  send pics as soon as it happens. i owe you a drink if you actually do it.
  did you cut your hair yet? You should atleast try out the half buzz before rotr....
  i always knew you were a steelers fan at heart...
 Download the track  from  & support the Black & Yellow! Go Steelers!! 
  well this time it happens to be for the MAAW tour....but this is a recurring theme ALL the time.
