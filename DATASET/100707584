 Many evangelicals fear the Muslim versions of themselves, yet want their own flavor of "shariah" in this country.
 The first draft of my first-ever sermon is written! Now it's back to the day job.
 RT  John Adams to Rick Perry: Don’t meddle in religion 
  That's how I'm reading it.
 Evangelicals fear the Muslim version of themselves.
 As soon as we make groups, even casual ones, we're set up for disappointment and feeding our exclusionary tenencies. How do we fight this?
 This kids-to-bed-after-10 thing should probably stop soon...
  That's beautiful, thanks for passing it along as I must have missed it when Brian tweeted it.
 Is all the fear just based on the Roman Empire falling? That wasn't actually caused by gay people, folks. SMH.
  well, not literally wooly.
 Luckily, I missed the rain getting home. It was a little wild and wooly here.
  LOVE listening to my kids singing when they don't know I'm listening!
  it backfired. I am a very distant observer, but the issue seems complex and difficult to me.
  just as an aside, since the nines are coming up, I remember people asking for wider representation. Op tried to do that.
  A buddy of mine from work is going to be there. Arcade Fire opening too, should be an awesome show.
  I tried explaining that to my 6yo awhile back. I remember eyes glazing over...
   So if even 6+% of serious couples wanted to get married at the drop of a hat w/o party/ceremony, that's a lot.
   Maybe 50% in a relationship. We don't marry everyone dated. If we marry every 3rd partner, that's 16% potential.
  Seriously? A full 1% of the LGBT population wanted to get married and that's a low number? cc: 
  i would be honored to join the likes of  I'm swamped for the next week, maybe something about Wesleyan quad?
 Working a lot lately. Just finally heading home to see the kids before they go to sleep.
  Well, Leviticus is fine with lesbians. Amirite?
  We have an amazing capacity to lie to ourselves.
 The president is required to pay appropriations of Congress. It is unconstitutional for Congress to disallow him from doing so.
  Well, it's fear, and confusion, and boxing oneself into a corner where one forces oneself to be an asshole.
  Thinking about the cognitive dissonance that is required to blame kids for their own suicides makes me physically ill.
 The spending "binge" is not Obama's. Congress directs the president to spend money. And now is holding hostage his ability to do so.
  Wesley's notion that scripture, reason, experience and tradition all inform our theology.
 And you can fill in many historically 
 Tradition kept us from having meaningful experience with LGBT, which caused a reading of scripture, which prevented reasoning differently.
 So when I say that my experience eventually wins out over what I thought I knew, that's the framework in which I'm speaking.
 The Wesleyan quadrilateral allows for experience and reason to qestion tradition and Biblical interpretation.
 RT  FBI training PowerPoint includes 'frightening' depiction of Islam 
 If there's a conflict between what I know and what I experience, eventually what I experience is going to win.
  Not everyone has the intellectual ability to increase beyond a low wage.
  Well, it is actually quite difficult to raise a family on, say $20K a year.
  Yes, it is. No desire to seriously think about anything. Just say what people want to hear and then put on J Vernon McGee.
  oh my.
  As should Muslim terrorist. Fundamentalism is dangerous whatever the belief system behind it.
 RT  The Muslims sought to establish interfaith peace w/ Christians 1300 yrs ago w/ this charter:   ...
  That's a lot more generosity than the european explorers offered the south american natives.
 So we might default on our debt and plunge the world into chaos, but at least we'll have an NFL season.
  Yes, I know them too. One of the things that makes me saddest about the state of peoples' understanding of the gospel.
  I'd like if we could all at least agree with his hope. He's pretty conservative in the end.
  i agree, it's really uncomfortable to realize the depth of humanity's prejudices.  is particularly depressing.
 RT  Happy Marriage Equality Day, New York!!! Congratulations to all of today's couples! Grace be with you all.
 RT  New post: The Economic Disaster Of The GOP's Cut, Cap, Balance 
 The church always fails to address sexuality in a meaningful way. And responds to the resulting problems with more of the same.
   We'd have to disagree, I think. Perhaps we disagree on what fundamentalism is.
  Actually, last year NY enacted no-fault. Still a 6mo waiting period, I think.
  Must not have been in New York, those take years! Glad you've got closure.
   The point is that fundamentalism at its worst ends with this. Devout traditional Muslims condemn terrorism too.
 Just got a 24 point cribbage hand and went out on pegging before I could play it.
    Looking forward to reading it!
  Wow! I don't know if that's good or bad; trending topics aren't usually as intelligent and incisive as your tweets.
  Crossan says it's the belief that someone who disagrees with them cannot be a legitimate member of the religion.
  That's what majority of evangelicals have always believed. Fundamentalism is more.
   And Boehner voted for 5 of those increases.
  By the same standard that Muslim terrorists are Muslim, IMO.
   Well, people call the 9/11 terrorists Muslims, even though the Quran condemns killing innocents.
 Well if Perry thinks gay marriage is a state's rights issue, I expect he'll campaign on repealing the DOMA!
  I'm going to be speaking on the topic from a different perspective in August. Thanks for the thoughts.
  The shadow below the input box is a nice touch.
 Boehner is a toddler.
 Early today because I couldn't sleep with the A/C so cold. Also couldn't wake enough to turn it off.
  Hope you have a great visit with your mom. August it is!
  next week looking any better for you?
 Thankful for folks in and out of the  that keep me grounded and connected to the universal church.
 Good dinner out, heading home on the train.
  we are holding fast for now; looks like people won't be kicked out during appeal process.
   And don't forget to wear gloves and then go to the bathroom!
  heh, glad to hear I'm no missing much!
  I worked at a Dairy Queen with 15 girls when I was in high school. I learned very quickly.
  and you don't mock people that don't look like you, so I think you're a good tenant.
 Walked across the Manhattan Bridge last night. Now I have a large blister.
  Almost! Someone at work was selling two tickets but I had a schedule conflict. Still haven't seen them live.
 Quiet. In my apartment. How nice!
  I've been saying for years they need to drop the colonialist language; good news IMO.
 Later we look back and understand that the prophets had it right but we couldn't let go.
 Prophets predate this by crying out for things that aren't in our consciousness yet, but are dismissed especially early on.
 Somehow we figure out how to balance the already/not yet and only take really strong positions when society is in a place to handle them.
 Thinking: We take cues from culture in the church, like the Supreme Court. Slavery bad. Women in ministry in process. Vegetarianism not yet.
 Pretty much everywhere, it's gonna be hot.
  Ha! That is rich.

  That reminds me of the story in Samir's book; brought me to tears.
  Kate! Hope you had a good weekend!
  Great sermon; I really needed this reminder.
  what does it mean!!!!???
  Oh, happy birthday!
  Yeah, makes me wonder how long I can make it in a christianity that doesn't really want people like me around.
 OK, I need to write a confession liturgy.

  As an engineer, it's not good enough that something works. It needs to be beautiful. Code is written to be read later.
   That's an overgeneralization. Greg MacDonald/Robin Parry, for example, is quite dense reading. As is Elaine Pagels.
  it's 9:45 and we are still on the train with our 6 and 4 year olds.
  
 I will not let fear change my parenting. What happened in NYC was tragic, but the answer is not keeping kids locked up inside till age 18.
  Beautiful, Katie. I sent the link to my pastor.
      I'm deeply contrite and will ameliorate my behavior accordingly.
    No, not vituperatively. It's not my style. But I spoke my beliefs.
    I was too.
   Mark's actually more the type Jesus usually got mad at...
  If you're going to use OT law for this issue, it should be applied to Narnia, Lord of the Rings, etc. as well.
  Yeah. Just wow.
 SMH that people wonder whether it's OK to watch Harry Potter.
 Talkin' abiogenesis with the kid. I was never very good with biology.
 It's always entertaining when a group of 100 noisy kids on a field trip get on the subway.
  that's an argument I always had with my mom; she insisted god would have made a different way if people hadn't lied!
  *rimshot*
 Neocalvinists take Paul very seriously. Until he says there is neither male nor female in Christ.
   he would have to get a much more Christian understanding of gender and inclusion before he could be sorry.
   I believe sexuality is a continuum, and some people can choose either. Point is, I can't decide for them.
   I don't think it said that. He acknowledged being too honest with what he really thinks.
   And they keep saying it's nothing like civil rights.

  That was an awesome letter.

   Seriously, what was Jesus thinking? He should have franchised the carpenter business and planned for retirement.
  Cause we all know the gospel is about getting ahead in life!
 We are on the verge of default and the House is worried about LIGHT BULBS?
  that's really awesome! Looking forward to hearing more in the future.
  I really hate that song. I have been doing fewer of the "jumpy" songs lately.
  Amazing how people will support his utter lack of accountability. Good comparison.

  "it seems good to the holy spirit and to us..."
  It's inconvenient that the Bible includes people like Rahab, Ruth(!), Esther, Mary Magdalene.
  oh boy.
   ...but many will call out hatred and ad hominem attacks for what they are.
   Like many things in life, it's attitude that gets called out more often than views; OP is a diverse crowd...
   Exactly; who is "us" - we all choose who we feel we are safe with.
  Yeah, I'm trying to get the visual out of my head :D
   Because they were upset at not being nice to someone abusing a hashtag? He's much less civil than Pirate.
   How someone so hateful can complain about being bullied is beyond me.
  He said the Harlot will be a "church" that does good things for the wrong reasons, and Oprah is the "pastor" Next, antichrist.
 Is there any such thing as compassion and justice for the wrong reasons? I think Jesus disagrees with Mike Bickle.
 Wait, Oprah is ushering in the Antichrist? Wat?
 My beard is getting in the way of eating again. Especially ice cream.

 Current status: Sazerac with muscovado sugar, Bulleit rye, and two types of bitters.
  Yes, and also frustrating, because I tend to assume that others can be as moldable as I am.
  I tend to think that some people just are that way more than others. It could be learned or inborn.
 There are lots of things in my head right now. This can't continue indefinitely.
   interesting read, I'm in a denomination with pietist roots, maybe where I get my tendancy to self-reflection from.
 When this train finally shows, it will be crowded.
  gotcha. I was referring to post-death second chances, which might be equally applicable.
  smh
  don't think I got what you're saying, but my tweet was kinda cryptic...
  I've got a fever, and the only prescription is MORE DUCK!
 Can we stop calling it a "second chance"? For some, it's just a chance. (cc 
  god bless you in your new call :)
  I also feel called to stay where I am and work quietly for change.
  Thanks for the response. Perhaps maturity is decreasing how much we make god (and god's grace) in our image.
 I think we naturally want grace to be just good enough to accept us, but not better. God challenges us to widen that perspective.
 To follow up, I think the more we grow the less angry we will be that grace accepts people we don't want to accept. I have a ways to go.
  hi!
  Deep down I have trouble wishing grace for those who hate and tear down people I love.
  Life is a maybe a journey of becoming less angry about grace, but I often am more like Jonah than I'd like to be.
 We would all be at least a little angry if we really understood grace. If not, it's not really grace.
  I'm with you. It's hard to love people whose concept of love seems so twisted to me.
  Well, their usual bedtime is 9. Since we homeschool we don't need to get up early. I went to bed at 7:30 when I was their age.

 Mint procured. Pimm's Cups are now being consumed.
  Not really anything to be embarrassed by, IMO. I'm slightly jealous of your IRL hanging out, though :)
 So our evening plans got called for rain. We are going to stay in and make Pimm's Cups. Which involves me going out looking for mint...
  So, how's it going?
  It's drifted so far from the conservatism of 50 years ago that it's hardly recognizable.
  Heh, we live in Bushwick, which is much rougher than the Slope, but people say that about our hood now too.

 Apparently I fell asleep for a couple hours.
 Really looking forward to the weekend. Going to play some music with my wife if my hand pain doesn't flare up!
 I'm early today. I seem to be waking up earlier automatically when I sleep earlier. Does that mean Im getting old?
  I actually think it's had a lot of influence, just not always positive and not monolithic. Influence of religion waxes/wanes.
  Oops, sorry to upset you. But don't patronize me with the "you win" stuff. We disagree, that's all.
  In medieval Germany at least, they had sale marriage where the bride was basically purchased.
  Which was property rights and arranged marriages. I just don't see historical consistency or consensus.
  ... reaffirmed sacrament before priest, france and germany went with secular civil marriage only.
  luther and calvin thought marriage exclusively secular, puritans went further, JOP instead of minister. Council of Trent ...
  you mean christian western governments? actually church initially inherited ideas from roman society, evolved with church.
 Wife and I have started reading Unprotected Texts together. It's good so far.
   Congratulations, both of you!
 Conservatives, help me out: if marriage can't be decided through legislation, or courts, or executive fiat, who can decide?
  Ah. Mine was out of the blue, found on facebook and sent a msg. Wish I had gotten some response, but I had to say what I did.
   God help us.
  I did that a year or so ago, never heard anything in response. Hope it is well-received too.
  no, there was marriage. but defined by each society. polygamy, for example, has been normative through history, our govt says no
  gov't says i can't hire you to do >$600 of work for me without paying taxes. you can agree/disagree with taxes, still hafta pay.
  sorry i wasn't more clear...
  ok... you said the government has forgotten where marriage comes from. i'm saying it's secular and the people decided.
  Look, now there's your cited appeals case, and the will of the people. If challenged, court will have to decide which prevails.
  I don't like the term; it's judiciary's job to check other branches. I think it's funny how people employ it out of convenience.
  Since they use the term marriage for civil secular unions, the word means what the people decide it means.
  The government uses the term "marriage" because straight people would flip out if everything became civil unions.
  The people decided here through their duly elected representatives. It can be fought in court, and many will want activism then.
  conservatives want legislative action when the courts are "activist" and judicial action when they don't like legislation.
  Yes, various cases will have various rulings. My point is the NY law quotes US precedent in Loving - "fundamental right".
  that seems a bit steep.
 I will have heaphones on today and will accomplish great things. 
  aren't the mall glasses stores the cheapest?
  marriage as a fundamental right was determined by the supreme court in loving v Virginia (iirc) in the 60s. NY law just restates
  So true.
  I'm going with Bachmann because I can sing "Michelle" constantly during the campaign.

   That might be why the dev channel works better.
  that's unfortunate and one-dimensional...

 New ideas are always old ideas because every generation resists change in it's own way and has to be kicked in the ass.
 But those in power will always resist such disruptive change. Why would we be so arrogant as to think this ended in the 1st century?
 This is what Jesus said about the sabbath. It applies beyond too. When our interpretations harm, we need to change.
 We do not exist to serve gender; it's the other way around. Means we play a part in discerning whether our approach is helpful or not.

    Did they pioneer it, or is it older than that and THEY rediscovered it, like we all do continually?
    I'm in the evangelical world; I think the book is very important here.
  all I remember is "the thinging thing things"
   nothing to think about yet, or am I missing something? The quote wasn't explained at all.
  thank god they can't point to liberal decline as evidence of god's opinion on their theology now.

  There are no other tweets with that hashtag.
 Finally on the bridge. This train is slow today.
 RT  RT  GOP candidate Herman Cain tells CBSNews.com homosexuality is a sin and a choice: 
 Many evangelicals fear the Muslim versions of themselves, yet want their own flavor of "shariah" in this country.
 The first draft of my first-ever sermon is written! Now it's back to the day job.

  That's how I'm reading it.
 Evangelicals fear the Muslim version of themselves.
 As soon as we make groups, even casual ones, we're set up for disappointment and feeding our exclusionary tenencies. How do we fight this?
 This kids-to-bed-after-10 thing should probably stop soon...
  That's beautiful, thanks for passing it along as I must have missed it when Brian tweeted it.
 Is all the fear just based on the Roman Empire falling? That wasn't actually caused by gay people, folks. SMH.
  well, not literally wooly.
 Luckily, I missed the rain getting home. It was a little wild and wooly here.
  LOVE listening to my kids singing when they don't know I'm listening!
  it backfired. I am a very distant observer, but the issue seems complex and difficult to me.
  just as an aside, since the nines are coming up, I remember people asking for wider representation. Op tried to do that.
  A buddy of mine from work is going to be there. Arcade Fire opening too, should be an awesome show.
  I tried explaining that to my 6yo awhile back. I remember eyes glazing over...
   So if even 6+% of serious couples wanted to get married at the drop of a hat w/o party/ceremony, that's a lot.
   Maybe 50% in a relationship. We don't marry everyone dated. If we marry every 3rd partner, that's 16% potential.
  Seriously? A full 1% of the LGBT population wanted to get married and that's a low number? cc: 
  i would be honored to join the likes of  I'm swamped for the next week, maybe something about Wesleyan quad?

  Well, Leviticus is fine with lesbians. Amirite?
  We have an amazing capacity to lie to ourselves.
 The president is required to pay appropriations of Congress. It is unconstitutional for Congress to disallow him from doing so.
  Well, it's fear, and confusion, and boxing oneself into a corner where one forces oneself to be an asshole.
  Thinking about the cognitive dissonance that is required to blame kids for their own suicides makes me physically ill.
 The spending "binge" is not Obama's. Congress directs the president to spend money. And now is holding hostage his ability to do so.
  Wesley's notion that scripture, reason, experience and tradition all inform our theology.
 And you can fill in many historically 
 Tradition kept us from having meaningful experience with LGBT, which caused a reading of scripture, which prevented reasoning differently.
 So when I say that my experience eventually wins out over what I thought I knew, that's the framework in which I'm speaking.
 The Wesleyan quadrilateral allows for experience and reason to qestion tradition and Biblical interpretation.

 If there's a conflict between what I know and what I experience, eventually what I experience is going to win.
  Not everyone has the intellectual ability to increase beyond a low wage.
  Well, it is actually quite difficult to raise a family on, say $20K a year.
  Yes, it is. No desire to seriously think about anything. Just say what people want to hear and then put on J Vernon McGee.

 The church always fails to address sexuality in a meaningful way. And responds to the resulting problems with more of the same.
   We'd have to disagree, I think. Perhaps we disagree on what fundamentalism is.
  Actually, last year NY enacted no-fault. Still a 6mo waiting period, I think.
  Must not have been in New York, those take years! Glad you've got closure.
   The point is that fundamentalism at its worst ends with this. Devout traditional Muslims condemn terrorism too.
 Just got a 24 point cribbage hand and went out on pegging before I could play it.
    Looking forward to reading it!
  Wow! I don't know if that's good or bad; trending topics aren't usually as intelligent and incisive as your tweets.
  Crossan says it's the belief that someone who disagrees with them cannot be a legitimate member of the religion.
  That's what majority of evangelicals have always believed. Fundamentalism is more.
   And Boehner voted for 5 of those increases.
  By the same standard that Muslim terrorists are Muslim, IMO.
   Well, people call the 9/11 terrorists Muslims, even though the Quran condemns killing innocents.
 Well if Perry thinks gay marriage is a state's rights issue, I expect he'll campaign on repealing the DOMA!
  I'm going to be speaking on the topic from a different perspective in August. Thanks for the thoughts.
  The shadow below the input box is a nice touch.
 Boehner is a toddler.

 Quiet. In my apartment. How nice!
  I've been saying for years they need to drop the colonialist language; good news IMO.
 Later we look back and understand that the prophets had it right but we couldn't let go.
 Prophets predate this by crying out for things that aren't in our consciousness yet, but are dismissed especially early on.
 Somehow we figure out how to balance the already/not yet and only take really strong positions when society is in a place to handle them.
 Thinking: We take cues from culture in the church, like the Supreme Court. Slavery bad. Women in ministry in process. Vegetarianism not yet.

 Neocalvinists take Paul very seriously. Until he says there is neither male nor female in Christ.
   he would have to get a much more Christian understanding of gender and inclusion before he could be sorry.
   I believe sexuality is a continuum, and some people can choose either. Point is, I can't decide for them.
   I don't think it said that. He acknowledged being too honest with what he really thinks.

   Like many things in life, it's attitude that gets called out more often than views; OP is a diverse crowd...
   Exactly; who is "us" - we all choose who we feel we are safe with.
  Yeah, I'm trying to get the visual out of my head :D
   Because they were upset at not being nice to someone abusing a hashtag? He's much less civil than Pirate.
   How someone so hateful can complain about being bullied is beyond me.
  He said the Harlot will be a "church" that does good things for the wrong reasons, and Oprah is the "pastor" Next, antichrist.
 Is there any such thing as compassion and justice for the wrong reasons? I think Jesus disagrees with Mike Bickle.

 Can we stop calling it a "second chance"? For some, it's just a chance. (cc 
  god bless you in your new call :)
  I also feel called to stay where I am and work quietly for change.
  Thanks for the response. Perhaps maturity is decreasing how much we make god (and god's grace) in our image.
 I think we naturally want grace to be just good enough to accept us, but not better. God challenges us to widen that perspective.
 To follow up, I think the more we grow the less angry we will be that grace accepts people we don't want to accept. I have a ways to go.
  hi!
  Deep down I have trouble wishing grace for those who hate and tear down people I love.
  Life is a maybe a journey of becoming less angry about grace, but I often am more like Jonah than I'd like to be.
 We would all be at least a little angry if we really understood grace. If not, it's not really grace.
  I'm with you. It's hard to love people whose concept of love seems so twisted to me.

 Really looking forward to the weekend. Going to play some music with my wife if my hand pain doesn't flare up!
 I'm early today. I seem to be waking up earlier automatically when I sleep earlier. Does that mean Im getting old?
  I actually think it's had a lot of influence, just not always positive and not monolithic. Influence of religion waxes/wanes.
  Oops, sorry to upset you. But don't patronize me with the "you win" stuff. We disagree, that's all.
  In medieval Germany at least, they had sale marriage where the bride was basically purchased.
  Which was property rights and arranged marriages. I just don't see historical consistency or consensus.
  ... reaffirmed sacrament before priest, france and germany went with secular civil marriage only.
  luther and calvin thought marriage exclusively secular, puritans went further, JOP instead of minister. Council of Trent ...
  you mean christian western governments? actually church initially inherited ideas from roman society, evolved with church.
 Wife and I have started reading Unprotected Texts together. It's good so far.
   Congratulations, both of you!
 Conservatives, help me out: if marriage can't be decided through legislation, or courts, or executive fiat, who can decide?
  Ah. Mine was out of the blue, found on facebook and sent a msg. Wish I had gotten some response, but I had to say what I did.
   God help us.
  I did that a year or so ago, never heard anything in response. Hope it is well-received too.
  no, there was marriage. but defined by each society. polygamy, for example, has been normative through history, our govt says no
  gov't says i can't hire you to do >$600 of work for me without paying taxes. you can agree/disagree with taxes, still hafta pay.
  sorry i wasn't more clear...
  ok... you said the government has forgotten where marriage comes from. i'm saying it's secular and the people decided.
  Look, now there's your cited appeals case, and the will of the people. If challenged, court will have to decide which prevails.
  I don't like the term; it's judiciary's job to check other branches. I think it's funny how people employ it out of convenience.
  Since they use the term marriage for civil secular unions, the word means what the people decide it means.
  The government uses the term "marriage" because straight people would flip out if everything became civil unions.
  The people decided here through their duly elected representatives. It can be fought in court, and many will want activism then.
  conservatives want legislative action when the courts are "activist" and judicial action when they don't like legislation.
  Yes, various cases will have various rulings. My point is the NY law quotes US precedent in Loving - "fundamental right".
  that seems a bit steep.
 I will have heaphones on today and will accomplish great things. 
  aren't the mall glasses stores the cheapest?
  marriage as a fundamental right was determined by the supreme court in loving v Virginia (iirc) in the 60s. NY law just restates
  So true.

 New ideas are always old ideas because every generation resists change in it's own way and has to be kicked in the ass.
 But those in power will always resist such disruptive change. Why would we be so arrogant as to think this ended in the 1st century?
 This is what Jesus said about the sabbath. It applies beyond too. When our interpretations harm, we need to change.
 We do not exist to serve gender; it's the other way around. Means we play a part in discerning whether our approach is helpful or not.

  I believe PBR is a requirement. So I fail.
 I'd probably need an ironic tattoo also.
 I guess I would be a hipster. If I didn't have a wife and two kids. And if I could choke down a PBR.

      I try to reject the "hipster" label, but not always successfully.
      Too lazy to squeeze lime. Bulleit rye, aperol and sweet vermouth it is
      OK, you guys talked me into it. What to make? Something with fernet?
      I should wait for my wife to get home to make a drink, but maybe not.
 Ah, reading further it appears that some intelligent commenters already responded well to  cisprivilege. Carry on.
 I might be wrong, but it seems like  just reduced trans people to expressing a "consumer preference." Hmm.
    Did they pioneer it, or is it older than that and THEY rediscovered it, like we all do continually?
    I'm in the evangelical world; I think the book is very important here.
  all I remember is "the thinging thing things"
   nothing to think about yet, or am I missing something? The quote wasn't explained at all.
  thank god they can't point to liberal decline as evidence of god's opinion on their theology now.

  There are no other tweets with that hashtag.
 Finally on the bridge. This train is slow today.
 RT  RT  GOP candidate Herman Cain tells CBSNews.com homosexuality is a sin and a choice: 
 Many evangelicals fear the Muslim versions of themselves, yet want their own flavor of "shariah" in this country.
 The first draft of my first-ever sermon is written! Now it's back to the day job.
 RT  John Adams to Rick Perry: Don’t meddle in religion 
  That's how I'm reading it.
 Evangelicals fear the Muslim version of themselves.
 As soon as we make groups, even casual ones, we're set up for disappointment and feeding our exclusionary tenencies. How do we fight this?
 This kids-to-bed-after-10 thing should probably stop soon...
  That's beautiful, thanks for passing it along as I must have missed it when Brian tweeted it.
 Is all the fear just based on the Roman Empire falling? That wasn't actually caused by gay people, folks. SMH.
  well, not literally wooly.
 Luckily, I missed the rain getting home. It was a little wild and wooly here.
  LOVE listening to my kids singing when they don't know I'm listening!
  it backfired. I am a very distant observer, but the issue seems complex and difficult to me.
  just as an aside, since the nines are coming up, I remember people asking for wider representation. Op tried to do that.
  A buddy of mine from work is going to be there. Arcade Fire opening too, should be an awesome show.
  I tried explaining that to my 6yo awhile back. I remember eyes glazing over...
   So if even 6+% of serious couples wanted to get married at the drop of a hat w/o party/ceremony, that's a lot.
   Maybe 50% in a relationship. We don't marry everyone dated. If we marry every 3rd partner, that's 16% potential.
  Seriously? A full 1% of the LGBT population wanted to get married and that's a low number? cc: 
  i would be honored to join the likes of  I'm swamped for the next week, maybe something about Wesleyan quad?
 Working a lot lately. Just finally heading home to see the kids before they go to sleep.
  Well, Leviticus is fine with lesbians. Amirite?
  We have an amazing capacity to lie to ourselves.
 The president is required to pay appropriations of Congress. It is unconstitutional for Congress to disallow him from doing so.
  Well, it's fear, and confusion, and boxing oneself into a corner where one forces oneself to be an asshole.
  Thinking about the cognitive dissonance that is required to blame kids for their own suicides makes me physically ill.
 The spending "binge" is not Obama's. Congress directs the president to spend money. And now is holding hostage his ability to do so.
  Wesley's notion that scripture, reason, experience and tradition all inform our theology.
 And you can fill in many historically 
 Tradition kept us from having meaningful experience with LGBT, which caused a reading of scripture, which prevented reasoning differently.
 So when I say that my experience eventually wins out over what I thought I knew, that's the framework in which I'm speaking.
 The Wesleyan quadrilateral allows for experience and reason to qestion tradition and Biblical interpretation.
 RT  FBI training PowerPoint includes 'frightening' depiction of Islam 
 If there's a conflict between what I know and what I experience, eventually what I experience is going to win.
  Not everyone has the intellectual ability to increase beyond a low wage.
  Well, it is actually quite difficult to raise a family on, say $20K a year.
  Yes, it is. No desire to seriously think about anything. Just say what people want to hear and then put on J Vernon McGee.

  As should Muslim terrorist. Fundamentalism is dangerous whatever the belief system behind it.

 The church always fails to address sexuality in a meaningful way. And responds to the resulting problems with more of the same.
   We'd have to disagree, I think. Perhaps we disagree on what fundamentalism is.
  Actually, last year NY enacted no-fault. Still a 6mo waiting period, I think.
  Must not have been in New York, those take years! Glad you've got closure.
   The point is that fundamentalism at its worst ends with this. Devout traditional Muslims condemn terrorism too.
 Just got a 24 point cribbage hand and went out on pegging before I could play it.
    Looking forward to reading it!
  Wow! I don't know if that's good or bad; trending topics aren't usually as intelligent and incisive as your tweets.
  Crossan says it's the belief that someone who disagrees with them cannot be a legitimate member of the religion.
  That's what majority of evangelicals have always believed. Fundamentalism is more.
   And Boehner voted for 5 of those increases.
  By the same standard that Muslim terrorists are Muslim, IMO.
   Well, people call the 9/11 terrorists Muslims, even though the Quran condemns killing innocents.
 Well if Perry thinks gay marriage is a state's rights issue, I expect he'll campaign on repealing the DOMA!
  I'm going to be speaking on the topic from a different perspective in August. Thanks for the thoughts.
  The shadow below the input box is a nice touch.
 Boehner is a toddler.
 Early today because I couldn't sleep with the A/C so cold. Also couldn't wake enough to turn it off.

  next week looking any better for you?
 Thankful for folks in and out of the  that keep me grounded and connected to the universal church.
 Good dinner out, heading home on the train.

  Almost! Someone at work was selling two tickets but I had a schedule conflict. Still haven't seen them live.
 Quiet. In my apartment. How nice!
  I've been saying for years they need to drop the colonialist language; good news IMO.
 Later we look back and understand that the prophets had it right but we couldn't let go.
 Prophets predate this by crying out for things that aren't in our consciousness yet, but are dismissed especially early on.
 Somehow we figure out how to balance the already/not yet and only take really strong positions when society is in a place to handle them.
 Thinking: We take cues from culture in the church, like the Supreme Court. Slavery bad. Women in ministry in process. Vegetarianism not yet.

 Neocalvinists take Paul very seriously. Until he says there is neither male nor female in Christ.
   he would have to get a much more Christian understanding of gender and inclusion before he could be sorry.
   I believe sexuality is a continuum, and some people can choose either. Point is, I can't decide for them.
   I don't think it said that. He acknowledged being too honest with what he really thinks.
   And they keep saying it's nothing like civil rights.

  It's inconvenient that the Bible includes people like Rahab, Ruth(!), Esther, Mary Magdalene.
  oh boy.
   ...but many will call out hatred and ad hominem attacks for what they are.
   Like many things in life, it's attitude that gets called out more often than views; OP is a diverse crowd...
   Exactly; who is "us" - we all choose who we feel we are safe with.
  Yeah, I'm trying to get the visual out of my head :D
   Because they were upset at not being nice to someone abusing a hashtag? He's much less civil than Pirate.
   How someone so hateful can complain about being bullied is beyond me.
  He said the Harlot will be a "church" that does good things for the wrong reasons, and Oprah is the "pastor" Next, antichrist.
 Is there any such thing as compassion and justice for the wrong reasons? I think Jesus disagrees with Mike Bickle.
 Wait, Oprah is ushering in the Antichrist? Wat?

  Yes, and also frustrating, because I tend to assume that others can be as moldable as I am.
  I tend to think that some people just are that way more than others. It could be learned or inborn.
 There are lots of things in my head right now. This can't continue indefinitely.

 Can we stop calling it a "second chance"? For some, it's just a chance. (cc 
  god bless you in your new call :)
  I also feel called to stay where I am and work quietly for change.
  Thanks for the response. Perhaps maturity is decreasing how much we make god (and god's grace) in our image.
 I think we naturally want grace to be just good enough to accept us, but not better. God challenges us to widen that perspective.
 To follow up, I think the more we grow the less angry we will be that grace accepts people we don't want to accept. I have a ways to go.
  hi!
  Deep down I have trouble wishing grace for those who hate and tear down people I love.
  Life is a maybe a journey of becoming less angry about grace, but I often am more like Jonah than I'd like to be.
 We would all be at least a little angry if we really understood grace. If not, it's not really grace.
  I'm with you. It's hard to love people whose concept of love seems so twisted to me.

 Really looking forward to the weekend. Going to play some music with my wife if my hand pain doesn't flare up!
 I'm early today. I seem to be waking up earlier automatically when I sleep earlier. Does that mean Im getting old?
  I actually think it's had a lot of influence, just not always positive and not monolithic. Influence of religion waxes/wanes.
  Oops, sorry to upset you. But don't patronize me with the "you win" stuff. We disagree, that's all.
  In medieval Germany at least, they had sale marriage where the bride was basically purchased.
  Which was property rights and arranged marriages. I just don't see historical consistency or consensus.
  ... reaffirmed sacrament before priest, france and germany went with secular civil marriage only.
  luther and calvin thought marriage exclusively secular, puritans went further, JOP instead of minister. Council of Trent ...
  you mean christian western governments? actually church initially inherited ideas from roman society, evolved with church.
 Wife and I have started reading Unprotected Texts together. It's good so far.
   Congratulations, both of you!
 Conservatives, help me out: if marriage can't be decided through legislation, or courts, or executive fiat, who can decide?
  Ah. Mine was out of the blue, found on facebook and sent a msg. Wish I had gotten some response, but I had to say what I did.
   God help us.
  I did that a year or so ago, never heard anything in response. Hope it is well-received too.
  no, there was marriage. but defined by each society. polygamy, for example, has been normative through history, our govt says no
  gov't says i can't hire you to do >$600 of work for me without paying taxes. you can agree/disagree with taxes, still hafta pay.
  sorry i wasn't more clear...
  ok... you said the government has forgotten where marriage comes from. i'm saying it's secular and the people decided.
  Look, now there's your cited appeals case, and the will of the people. If challenged, court will have to decide which prevails.
  I don't like the term; it's judiciary's job to check other branches. I think it's funny how people employ it out of convenience.
  Since they use the term marriage for civil secular unions, the word means what the people decide it means.
  The government uses the term "marriage" because straight people would flip out if everything became civil unions.
  The people decided here through their duly elected representatives. It can be fought in court, and many will want activism then.
  conservatives want legislative action when the courts are "activist" and judicial action when they don't like legislation.
  Yes, various cases will have various rulings. My point is the NY law quotes US precedent in Loving - "fundamental right".
  that seems a bit steep.
 I will have heaphones on today and will accomplish great things. 
  aren't the mall glasses stores the cheapest?
  marriage as a fundamental right was determined by the supreme court in loving v Virginia (iirc) in the 60s. NY law just restates
  So true.

 New ideas are always old ideas because every generation resists change in it's own way and has to be kicked in the ass.
 But those in power will always resist such disruptive change. Why would we be so arrogant as to think this ended in the 1st century?
 This is what Jesus said about the sabbath. It applies beyond too. When our interpretations harm, we need to change.
 We do not exist to serve gender; it's the other way around. Means we play a part in discerning whether our approach is helpful or not.
