 One of our resellers brought the Solido SD300 Pro 3D Printer to the APMM show in Boston!  Here is a link to the photo on APMM's FB page...
 We keep getting lots of feedback that says our 3D machine is great for  - what are architects looking for in a rapid prototype?
   Hi Randall - to get the Printer price of $2,950 - you have to commit to 24 Kits ˆJD
 RT  I met Avatar producer James Cameron recently and had a short chat with him about 3D printing: 
  Welcome to Twitter - good to see you here! ˆJD
 Presidents that were also Engineers: RT  . Herbert Hoover and Jimmy Carter :) Happy Presidents Day! 
 Thank you mechanical engineers - we celebrate National  ˆJD
 Asking: Best Color for 3D Models/Parts - We offer five colors: Amber (transparent), Cream, Black, Dark Blue, and... 
 we launched our community page on GetSatisfaction:  - Looking forward to interacting w/ our Customers!
  Right on - that shirt looks great on you! ˆJD
  Yes.  The material is an unplasticised polyvinyl chloride film.  That is a very good question to bring up.
  There are a number of furniture mfgs that want the waste material to make things like casters ˆJD
  while not in stone - we are considering a discount on molding material when you send your waste back in the provided bag ˆJD
  worth noting that our process doesn't require a phase change - we don't melt it - near room temperature the whole time ˆJD
  We are actually non-toxic and recyclable - and our process is clean - doesn't require a chemical bath w/ hazmat products ˆJD
  thanks man - very much appreciated ˆJD
  why is PVC a deal killer for you - just so we understand ˆJD
  believe it or not we are trying really hard to make pricing easy & we know with volume we'll be able to go much lower ˆJD
  BTW - our nearest competitor is > $14K just for the printer! Not to mention a chemical bath unit & expensive materials ˆJD
  molding material is essential - to reach a 3D printer price of $2,950, you must commit to enough material to offset our loss ˆJD
  It's a coordination thing - the US Division has been ultra-focused on a good show at   ˆJD
  if you're a member of the press & didn't get an invite to our Virtual Press Room - please let me know - it has graphics, video, etc.
  okay the Z axis is 150 microns or 0.0066" & +/- 0.0039" XY (100 microns) - wall thickness is 150 microns - very strong & flex ˆJD
  did I answer your questions - I've lost my mind at   ˆJD
  BTW somebody mentioned you as one of the top 7 most influential in the CAD industry - FYI ˆJD
  Dude - never got that Ron's Burger at our booth - I flew out, but a t-shirt should be waiting for you!
  I flew out last night, but ask for Scot Cook today - he'd be happy to show you the technology :)  ˆJD
  We are working with Javelin Technologies up in your neck of the woods!  ˆJD
  $360 per Kit at 99¢ per cubic inch is approximately 364 cubic inches per kit - it's an 8kg roll ˆJD
  I was hoping you'd say that - I started creating one this morning -I'll invite you, Ben, Lou et al - please give feedback ˆJD
  great meeting you at the TweetUp last night - hope to speak w/ you at the Booth or Press Conference today 
   hey - great meeting you last night! ˆJD
  Where in Canada? ˆJD
  1 Kit will print about 6 parts (average 1.5" Z, 8" X and 6" Y) - don't know if that helps ˆJD
  Consumables are $360 for molding material, Glue and Anti-glue - enough to print for 24 to 48 hours depending on intricacy ˆJD
  do you think a virtual press room with hi-res images, video links and that kind of stuff would be good?
  Ryan - ask away! I'll answer what I can & get you answers on things I don't know ˆJD
  Absolutely - the formal announcement is actually today - but we will provide detail online within the next few days or sooner! ˆJD
  thx, great feedback! We're going to find a way to get 3D printers, ours in particular, on lots & lots of desktops! Price is key!
  thanks for helping me yesterday - video worked great - you rock! Also enjoyed getting to know you at the TweetUp. See you later today
  Hey Lou - I am in my room waiting on the video to export - estimating 36 minutes. I am also waiting on DVDs to get delivered. ˆJD
  We had a misprint in our video for the show & had to redo the video, that's done - but need to burn to DVD & iDVD isn't on our Mac
 Anybody at  World with a Mac and iDVD? If so, could really use your help! ˆJD
  Got it - watched episode 8 - now I can add a dimmer switch ˆJD
  sounds good - are you going to the TweetUp on Sunday night? ˆJD
  Hey man thanks - I would have waited for 100 - now we have   ˆJD
  dude I have to relearn that every time I create a FB page - it may wait until you add a page - usually on the upper left.
  Great!   found your website, still looking for you on facebook. Stop by our booth at SWW!  507..I will save you a tshirt!
  Is it 25 now - I thought it was still 100- if 25, we have just 3 to go - Woot! ˆJD
   It looks like you made it to our FB page - thanks for becoming a fan! ˆJD
  Just added your FB page to ours! Were you able to locate our page on Facebook? ˆJD
  Yeah - that was fun doing our first unboxing. It is pretty serious and well engineered packaging! ˆJD
  That's weird - I tested it via Twitter and that link worked fine for me - well thx anyway man!
   Ahhh man! Try this: 
  You're killing me - $0.50!!! We will see you at  for sure - I'll try to keep a Solido T-Shirt for you!  
  Hey there - we just got our FB Page rolling - here is the link:
  Added your SolidSmack Facebook page to our Page - just starting our FB presence - would appreciate you as a fan!
  You'll definitely have to stop by Booth 507 - eager to see your reaction to our announced price and finance options ˆJD
  Excellent - ask for John. I'll hold one of 500 give-a-way T-shirts for you - like the one I'm wearing   ˆJD
  We're looking forward to catching up with you guys at the Show! Are you attending the Tweetup on Sunday? 
  Are you attending? Stop by Booth 507 - if possible, bring a Ron's Special Burger!!! I miss that place -  Love Tulsa!
 We got our T-Shirts for the SolidWorks World Show in Anaheim, CA  - That's right Baby... We Do It In 3D!!!   ^jd
  Hopefully of Concordian proportions!!!
  We can hardly wait to announce - it's going to be exciting - there's a perfect storm brewing!!! ˆJD
 The back of the Solido SD 300 PRO 3D Printer - just in case you're curious!  ^jd
  What did you think?
  turns out our sales guys are in Toronto today thru tomorrow. If they have a break in the schedule, would you like to meet?
  Can't tell from twitter, what's your URL? are you a service bureau?
  Price makes us competitive w/ open source alternatives - not os, but believe os will help drive 3D Printer innovation ˆJD
  why pool cash, get a pro-quality 3D Printer for way less than the other guys - we unveil pricing at SolidWorks World 1/31
 After a week, the USA branch of Solido is impressed w/ our ability to create 3D objects - pyramids, horses, martial arts devices, etc.
  you can probably reduce your time for saving - we'll unveil unbelievable pricing for a high-quality 3D Printer on Jan. 31st!
  Most definitely - thanks for your assistance today! ˆJD
  Hey John - do you know any 3D CAD designers in the Phoenix area? We are looking to add one to our team. Thanks.
 We are looking for a 3D CAD Designer to join our team in the Phoenix Area - anybody? ˆJD
  how many 3D designers do you guys have?
 Can't believe how much detail to prepare for SolidWorks World - only 3 weeks left to get it done! ˆJD
  What are you comparing Inventor to, if anything?
 Working on our promotional give-a-ways for the SolidWorks World show - any great ideas?
  Congrats!
 Day 2 of SolidWorks World Strategy session for Solido USA  
  Have you converted  files to STL?
  We just went through unpacking training - next we test our printer! 
 Making it through our 2-day strategy session in preparation of SolidWorks World
 Anyone w/ experience buying a 3D Printer? From who? Was it good or bad? Trying to identify/associate w/ only the best.  
 I posted 9 photos on Facebook in the album "Kick Off Dinner" 
  Blown away by intricate samples delivered at our kick-off dinner for Solido USA  - amazing 3D Printing!
 Happy to be on Facebook!
