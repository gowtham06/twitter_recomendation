 Eastside way of life.
  just dont get like jay electronica. lol
 The actors are playing the roles of themselves but still acting..lol
 Its about some regular ass niggas from the eastside just chillin, smokin weed, partying and making music.
 I wrote a movie script...Its called "Eastside Way of Life"
  are you gonna be performing and shit
  the jammin part...
  I agree with that statement
  so i was just like...man 96 is possibly my least fav year after reminiscent about all this shit. I didnt say it was bad
  I was watching a hip hop documentary about the years and in the 1996 part all i was hearing was hella wack songs
  There was alot of GREAT shit that came out of 96, but also alot of terrible music.
  i didnt say the production was bad... It was something about it that bothered me Its hard to explain
  naw i apreciate you being real with me. You been lookin out for a nigga recently
  its a long story.... I know alot of legendary albums and songs came out in that year...I just didnt have an interest in it.
 1996 was my least favorite year in rap...something about the production bothered me.
  A nigga was slippin, Im not gonna let that shit happen again. good lookin out.
  when you get the chance listen to the albums "lord willin" and "hell hath no fury" you might feel differently about pusha T
  sometimes I just use that shit to speak my mind, I forget that im representing something
  youre right. I didnt look at it like that.
   if i struggle to create something after a certain period of time, i have a tendency to start reading into things.
  drum patterns the exact same since they came out.
  im glad you agree
  its either because you talk to him...OR he clicked on your bandcamp page and hes making hella business moves as we speak
 The Cool Kids need to adapt with the music industry ASAP...that shit is starting to sound boring
  this is how i look right now... 
  0_0 YOU LUCKY MOTHER FUCKER
 The last teyana taylor song i heard was maybe 5 years ago. That marvins room "REMIX" doesnt count
  yea I would put Cyhi below Pusha and Cyhi is one of my favorite rappers. Its rap logic at the end of the day.
  youre right about the OF statement...Wiz khalifa and OF all the youth are talking about right now
  I really wouldnt even bring teyana taylor up because her irrelevance is beyond appalling. And she doesnt even release music
  or apreciate it like we do
  he was young AF during the Star Trak era.. alot of kids his age wouldnt know
 When I heard "rollin" I thought Jackie Chain was black.....boy was I wrong.
  if anybody is the weakest in g.o.o.d. I would say big sean...defenitely not Pusha T
 Highlight of my day: I sang a song for  and she said it sounded kinda "good"
  naw its not the same
  if you do then youre officially an odd future dickrider
 I just realized somethings dont really make sense unless you hear it said, not on a social network
  yea i know, i was refering to them if they consider themselves little brother fans
 Awww sheeet. i think im going through my star trak phase again. Im bout to be listening to the same shit for a min
  i would still be curious to hear their newer shit if I fucked with the old LB
  justus for all was cool. ill admit that I liked LB ALOT more when 9th was in the group. But I fuck with phonte also.
 Harder Better faster stronger "neptunes remix" us possibly better than the original. Its a close one
  i like the listening

  my fav  songs to cook to is "Cook that bitch" and "I cook"
  i dont fuck with wonton soup for some reason...that song sounds weird to me.
  you didnt like the pretty boy remix video?
  yea the video is disrespectful..but i like that beat for some reason.
  oh and pretty boy remix is fye af too..it is kinda why i think that nigga is the devil on earth though.
  "look like jesus" is my shit, that song changed that niggas career forever.
  lol yea you right, I only said that cuz its lil b and I support the movement.
  I thought lil b "im god" was coo
  and thats one of the fyest beats of all time
  I only recall 2 people rapping on that beat
  should rap to this beat, that would be kinda epic  
  yea it is still a great beat.
 Its ok... im used to being slept on
  I can see that it isnt a 9th beat now.. I just wanted to believe that it was ...smh
  I wish you could see the tears coming down from my eyes...one of my favorite 9th wonder beats isnt even a 9th wonder beat

 Eastside way of life.
  just dont get like jay electronica. lol
 The actors are playing the roles of themselves but still acting..lol
 Its about some regular ass niggas from the eastside just chillin, smokin weed, partying and making music.
 I wrote a movie script...Its called "Eastside Way of Life"
  are you gonna be performing and shit
  the jammin part...
  I agree with that statement
  so i was just like...man 96 is possibly my least fav year after reminiscent about all this shit. I didnt say it was bad
  I was watching a hip hop documentary about the years and in the 1996 part all i was hearing was hella wack songs
  There was alot of GREAT shit that came out of 96, but also alot of terrible music.
  i didnt say the production was bad... It was something about it that bothered me Its hard to explain
  naw i apreciate you being real with me. You been lookin out for a nigga recently
  its a long story.... I know alot of legendary albums and songs came out in that year...I just didnt have an interest in it.
 1996 was my least favorite year in rap...something about the production bothered me.
  A nigga was slippin, Im not gonna let that shit happen again. good lookin out.
  when you get the chance listen to the albums "lord willin" and "hell hath no fury" you might feel differently about pusha T
  sometimes I just use that shit to speak my mind, I forget that im representing something
  youre right. I didnt look at it like that.
   if i struggle to create something after a certain period of time, i have a tendency to start reading into things.
  drum patterns the exact same since they came out.
  im glad you agree
  its either because you talk to him...OR he clicked on your bandcamp page and hes making hella business moves as we speak
 The Cool Kids need to adapt with the music industry ASAP...that shit is starting to sound boring
  this is how i look right now... 
  0_0 YOU LUCKY MOTHER FUCKER
 The last teyana taylor song i heard was maybe 5 years ago. That marvins room "REMIX" doesnt count
  yea I would put Cyhi below Pusha and Cyhi is one of my favorite rappers. Its rap logic at the end of the day.
  youre right about the OF statement...Wiz khalifa and OF all the youth are talking about right now
  I really wouldnt even bring teyana taylor up because her irrelevance is beyond appalling. And she doesnt even release music
  or apreciate it like we do
  he was young AF during the Star Trak era.. alot of kids his age wouldnt know
 When I heard "rollin" I thought Jackie Chain was black.....boy was I wrong.
  if anybody is the weakest in g.o.o.d. I would say big sean...defenitely not Pusha T
 Highlight of my day: I sang a song for  and she said it sounded kinda "good"
  naw its not the same
  if you do then youre officially an odd future dickrider
 I just realized somethings dont really make sense unless you hear it said, not on a social network
  yea i know, i was refering to them if they consider themselves little brother fans
 Awww sheeet. i think im going through my star trak phase again. Im bout to be listening to the same shit for a min
  i would still be curious to hear their newer shit if I fucked with the old LB
  justus for all was cool. ill admit that I liked LB ALOT more when 9th was in the group. But I fuck with phonte also.
 Harder Better faster stronger "neptunes remix" us possibly better than the original. Its a close one
  i like the listening

  my fav  songs to cook to is "Cook that bitch" and "I cook"
  i dont fuck with wonton soup for some reason...that song sounds weird to me.
  you didnt like the pretty boy remix video?
  yea the video is disrespectful..but i like that beat for some reason.
  oh and pretty boy remix is fye af too..it is kinda why i think that nigga is the devil on earth though.
  "look like jesus" is my shit, that song changed that niggas career forever.
  lol yea you right, I only said that cuz its lil b and I support the movement.
  I thought lil b "im god" was coo
  and thats one of the fyest beats of all time
  I only recall 2 people rapping on that beat
  should rap to this beat, that would be kinda epic  
  yea it is still a great beat.
 Its ok... im used to being slept on
  I can see that it isnt a 9th beat now.. I just wanted to believe that it was ...smh
  I wish you could see the tears coming down from my eyes...one of my favorite 9th wonder beats isnt even a 9th wonder beat
  did you get satisfaction from telling me that "runs away crying" lol

 Im listening to neptunes remixes, and I kinda got the inspiration from there.
 That would be an accomplishment to remix an entire 20 track mixtape.
  aight. I was just thinking about doing a remix version of something...maybe  a couple months after you release it.
  yo can you send me the accapella version of some of the songs youve done and some youve recorded
