 Perhaps during this blizzard I'll get some more writing done!
  Amen...
 The blog would be  for those of us who have forgetten.  It has been awhile!
 Looks like the blog may even crank up to kick off 2011!!!  Plenty of old material and some new material coming soon!!!
 Hmm...  "New Twitter" and "New Coke" seem to be a little close for comfort.  Not certain I like the new interface...
 Celebrity hotspot in London!!  
 Still working on dusting off the blog and getting everyone back on the same page!
 The Hiatus has been far too long- but unfortunately we must pay the bills...
 Hey we may be returning soon!!!
 Almost back to abnormal after the storm.  NOW the weather is beautiful.
 Must have creative meeting with Marley soon...
 Slowly getting back to abnormal after the storm.  Basement still a mess...
 6 months ago, I submitted a comment card idea about a problem at Disney. Today I get an unsolicted idea letter. Way to listen to customers!
 I thought last week was crazy.  I was wrong.  Nearly four days without electricty.  THAT is crazy.
 I am alive!  It has just been a crazy busy week around the ranch...
 Wow, it's been an very busy week with business trips and meetings.  The blog should be updated this week...
 Wow.  Busier week than I had hoped.  Will get blog posted tomorrow if it kills me, and it probably will...
   Hamlet for certain.
 YAY!  I managed to rewrite two chapters in the manuscript and have forged ahead another 3,000 words!  Damn the torpedoes!  Full steam ahead!
   They can have it.
   ow you can have your Sony read any time you want!! :)
   I guess the important question is whose hair is it?
 Granny Redbeard returns!  With an edible recipe!   
 Granny Redbeard returns!  With an edible recipe!   
 Time for the weekly creative meeting with Marley, VP of Creative development on the books.  Granny Redbeard will return very soon too!
 Hmm- it seems like writing these books is a little like producing a movie.  I am re-doing one of the "Sets" and it... 
 Still snowing.  Maybe I can stop procrastinating and get some words on the manuscript...
  Apparently Chocolate Cake.  I guess that's not so bad on a snowy day...
 Just took "what dessert are you?" and got: chocolate cake! Try it ➔ 
 New Trail Rations column up!  Eat what the gang eats, if you dare...   
   Maybe you should refer to them as "Oedipal Candies..."
   Seems like a simply enough request...
  Because "Congress" is the opposite of "Progress"
  I second that...
  Yes.  This is weird.
  Six parts gin/vodka, one part vermouth...  Add an olive or two...
  Legal advice is hard to give in 140 characters.  It depends on what the text is being used for.
  Sharing recipes is good, unless they are Granny Redbeard's recipes...  Then I think it is at least a misdemeanor.
  If it was "legal text," it must be legible to the unaided eye of the average reader.  This would not qualify.
   Not illegal as far as I can tell (I don't know where they go), but bad design.
  Thanks for the mention!
   I guess simplicity is the secret...
   Well, if you sold a book to .05 percent of the population, that would still be sales of about 5,887,120.  I'd take those numbers.
 Arcane Enigmas Column up on the the Blog!   
 Wow!  The S&S Blog goes high-brow academic!
 The academic world cites the S&S Blog!!!... 
  Good luck!
 GAAAH!!!  So busy, I can't even get Granny Redbeard's latest culinary abuse up on the Blog! 
 Damn.  I had two chapters written, signed sealed and on their way to copy editing, and now I have a better idea, I... 
 Back in town!
  No problem!
 Heading out on a business trip.  Will be back on Sunday!
  Thanks again for the retweet!
 The latest and greatest project update!!!   
 Ack!  More white death falling from the sky like little paratroopers of doom!  English translation-  It's snowing again...
  Good to know.  Bit of a drive tonight, even for buttery, maple-y goodness...
  Why do fish swim and birds fly?  Or fish fly and birds swim?
  Yes, I am literally debating driving to the all-night diner to get some.  It's so sad.  It's 12:30 am.  Can;t make up my mind
  Wait...  does that include pancakes?  Pancakes are not evil...
  Oh yeah.  I wonder if Sherwood Diner is open?  We don't have an IHOP anymore.
  Wow, I could go for pancakes about now.  With a lot of butter and maple syrup!
  Thanks for the mention the other day!  Much appreciated!
 Granny Redbeard uses her brains!!! www.swordandsorcerybooks.wordpress.com 
 Time for my creative meeting with Marley.  haven't gotten much done today on the blog or the manuscript...
 About a foot total in snow.  Windy as hell though.
 For those keeping score- officially 9 inches of snow in Westport.  My weather station is saying 10.5.
 Wow.  Officially 5 inches here in Westport, but my little weather station is showing over 6...
 Anyway...  Snow is now falling.  I guess the blizzard is upon us here in New England...
  Well, it helps hide bruising...  Why am I saying this to the several million people that hang out on twitter?
  The jumper cables and rubber mallet probably have something to do with that.  We seem to have wandered down a bad path here.
  Well, evil people need love too.  I guess it comes down to is someone born evil, or is it a conscious choice?
  Well, you never call, you never write...  ;)
   Take a number.  They are saying 12-18 inches in the next 24 hours.  If I ever find out who "They" are, I'm going to punch them.
   I am terified to walk the dog, and it hasn't even started snowing yet!
   Either that or, "Go Postal!"
   I believe it is now, "It'll get there sooner or later.  Probably Later."
   Well, take your finger out of it, and it'll stop hurting...
  Nah, we're out here, terrified of the impending white doom of the blizzard...
   Okay... Just checking...  :)
  You've always had the ability to go home.  Just close your eyes and tap your heels together three times...
   You're not ammo'd up are you?  Do we need to be watching CNN?
  OMG!!!  Should I call in SWAT for a rescue?  I think the Geneva convention bans being snowed in with a 13 year old!
  Welcome to my world...
  Ah...  You have excellent taste.  Today is great day for a little Dylan Thomas.
  I can't wait to see this punchline...
  Yeah, vampires really bite...
   What do you need with money?  You have your daughter home now for nearly two weeks!!!
  Maybe it was a "whirlwind romance..."
  I've heard "The Checks in the mail" before, but it seems this time "the mail is in check"...
  R-Dog?
  Thomas or George???
  Yeah, but it was fun while it lasted.
   Was a mime involved?
  Thanks!
  Procrastinating...
  It just makes landing more of a challenge!
 The Extras have their say:  
 Calling for some serious snow tomorrow and Wednesday.  I hope the power stays on so I can get some writing done...... 
  Who's agenting it?
  I'd love to see more!
  No problem!
 Great.  Snow coming...
 Cool travel videos:  www.conwayconfidential.com
  Ouch.  True, but Ouch...
   I hope you feel better, both physically and mentally.
   But is true nonetheless...
  I'm guessing that they are looking better too...
   Comment away
   
 See how tough you are with this Superbowl Snack from Granny Redbeard!  
  Yes, but how can you see?
 See how tough you are with this Superbowl Snack from Granny Redbeard!   
 WOW!!!  The second straight day of shattering visitor records on the blog!  Am pleasantly surprised!... 
 No snow after all...
  Thanks!  I never thought that this day would come...
 Woohoo!  The big 500!  Okay, I know it's not a huge deal, but I thought I'd acknowledge the milestone anyway...
  Nice country at the top of the Valley!  I spent a fair amount of time out that way...
  You're the one singing...
  Must be nice having your own line at the DMV.  Is it the one by Tysons?  I never got out of there in under two hours...
  Sadly, modesty is not in my repertoire.
  I don't have the legs for them myself...
   Name that tune!
  Well, It'll be a while.  I hope you brought some reading materials!
  Hmm.  Seems we could come up with a quick and easy "Surprise" for dinner that will keep him from making that mistake again...
 Of course, if anyone else wants to add to today's record, check out  
 Just checked the S&S Blog Dashboard, and after a pretty slow week, we set a visitor record today!!!  Thanks... 
 Wow.  Checked the blog.  It had been a slow week but today I set a visitor record.  Thanks everybody!!!
 Up early.  May get some writing done before noon!
 Granny Redbeard has several recipes for this weekend's column and Hazel is bugging me about her new Trail Rations... 
 I'm up too late working on this.  Nearly 70,000 words for SHADOW'S LIGHT and a fair amount of basic mapping for... 
  What's Club 33?
 I put my iPod on "Shuffle" while I write and now I am disturbed.  It is freaky going from Nature sounds to Spinal Tap and then to Mozart...
  Well, I do feel like I have done my good deed for the day...
  Well, at least a life's ambition has been fulfilled on twitter.
  I know the feeling.
  Hallelujah, sister!
  Amen!
  It's been a slow week in general...  I guess people are busier this week than in recent ones.
  It's like an electronic North Korea.  Okay, maybe not that bad, but close...
  Right.  And THEY determine what is spam, not you...
  Yes, it just didn;t seem right.  I certainly wouldn't send an F/U to my agent.  I like her...
  Congrats!!!
  Oh... Follow up... Got it...
  Well, f/u's not a very nice thing to email someone.
 Appreciating the snow.  have some work to do, but will hopefully get some words down this afternoon.
  Well, elves are pretty cool.  Anything humans can do, elves can do better!
  Okay... maybe he's not like me then...  :)
  Glad you like him!  Oddly enough, he is the character I relate to the most I think...
 The S&S Blog characters pick the Super Bowl!!!
 The characters of the SHADOWS OF NIGHT Book Series pick the Superbowl!  
  Are they book PR people?  No offense, but publisher PR people just don;t have the time to be effective very often...
  I think all authors are affected by this mess as the industry changes before our very eyes...
  That works too...  I split time...
  As you wish...
  It seems very painful at the very least...
  Well, you'll get on just fine in New York City...
  Ok, here you go...  Jeez, you're always in such a rush...
 It's about time for my daily blog meeting with "Creative Director," Marley.    www.swordandsorcerybooks.wordpress.com 
   Good to know...
  We all would.  That's just the problem.
  The journey is too quick now, though I know it doesn't seem like it.  Then it becomes a blur.
  Well, real people will enjoy your pearls of wisom more than spammers...
  No.  I try and follow real people who follow me, but I don't generally follow "questionable" profiles
  Oh, take your time.  It is shocking how quickly it comes and goes, and frankly the journey is always more fun...
  No, but there always seems to be a "Fast Forward..."
 Trying to work on the manuscript, but chores seem to keep getting int he way...
  I'm sorry to hear that.  You sound close.
 Satiate your sweet tooth with Granny Redbeard's latest recipe: www.swordandsorcerybooks.wordpress.com 
  Probably not, but when they do, they'll be bowled over.
  Oh, I'm sure you paid for this "free time" dearly...
  What in sweet Jesus, is that???
  So... You're not 1,000% pure?
  An example of what?
  I find the cheese and fruit plate generally is a good compromise...
 Wow, now there is a Facebook Page AND a facebook fan page for the S&S Blog.  I'm so confused! 
 I still have not quite mastered this multi-platform thing.  Snow seems to be melting now...
 I apparently gave the announcement too early on twitter first, but here is the latest on the S&S Blog regarding... 
 So how effective is a dwarven hammer as a weapon?
 Gah!  The cleaning company is coming!  Lots of vacuums and noise!  Must hide to continue writing!
 Just working away and enjoying the snow.  Looks like we have about four inches this morning.
  I thought it was just a "term of endearment."
  Still stepping over bodies?  My god, do you never get enough carnage?
  The implication being that your dad does, but you don't...
  I guess that is what is meant by "jam session."
   "We're all mad here" - the Cheshire Cat.
  Good for you!  Hopefully after my "Conference" with Marley, I'll get some down tonight too...
 Marley and I are going to have a "Writer's conference" at the park.  We'll be back in a little while...
  But you're going to miss the rain and snow they're calling for...
   Apparently you guys don't follow EVERYONE back...
  Yes, but these tips are starting to sound like "John Wayne Gacy's Happy Housekeeping tips."  My blog already has dwarven cookery
  I do.  But putting the bodies out saves a fortune in bleach and lime.  Uh... we may have wandered down a bad path here...
  And the garbage men must be very annoyed with you.  All that extra stuff to cart off...
  I know!  It must wreak havoc with your pedicure and your manolos...  What's a girl to do?
  But you get enough of that at home; why do you need more in your life?
  I guess it depends on the story.  If it is an action piece, no.  If it is a children's book, then yes, they are sickos
  Eh, all you need to know about the world you can learn on twitter.  And maybe PBS or NPR.
  yeah,  set me straight on that!
  Your portfolio is great!  I will send you a note offline.
  You're lucky.  I had to take mine down by court order...
 WOW!  The facebook-Twitter connection works!  Oh, and new SHADOWS OF NIGHT project update!!!  
 New SHADOWS OF NIGHT project update!!!   
 Another day, hopefully another 2000 words on manuscript 2 SHADOW'S LIGHT! 
 Okay, so between Facebook, Twitter and the blog, the SHADOWS OF NIGHT campaign is off and more or less running! 
  Not yet.  I have some history books published out there, but these are the first fiction with my name on them.
  Oh, I have no shame...  But it is all in good fun, at least until the litigation starts...
  That is the right attitude!  (Then again, you have obviously not read the blog...)
  Oh, well, in a way, part of the day job is an online travel magazine and content provider:  www.conwayconfidential.com
  I know.  I'm so confused now...
  No, not yet at least.  I am a writer with a series of fantasy books and a rather silly support blog.
 Thanks   Nothing like getting the ball rolling.  You can say you were there from literally the very beginning!
 It is a little weird to be a fan of your own page... 
 Finally!  The Facebook page is up! 
  Welcvome to my World
 Good Night   Good night Grandpaw!
 You know, if everyone said "Goodnight" to each other on Twitter, we'd almost put the Waltons to shame...
 Want to add to the manuscript, but pretty tired.  maybe I'll have a writer's conference with the puppy...
 Inexplicably, the Fantasy Cookbook on the blog keeps expanding!
  That's worked for me for, well, longer than I will admit on twitter...
  And Just exactly what do you mean?  (Just kidding)
  Always end with a "loose end" that came up earlier in the story, but maybe the PCs did not pay that much attention to at the time
   Hey!  Hope to make your blog someday soon!
  Its appeal eludes me as well.
  Yeah!  It bites!
  Well, You got the "Disloyal" followers... So I guess I can live with that.  I really need to get out more...
  You probably got them from me.  I lost three today...
 Wow, I guess people do hate mime jokes.  I have lost three followers since yesterday!!!
  York, Jersey, Hampshire and Mexico.
  Time flies.  I guess you were having fun...
  Tempus fugit.
  Well, you still have three minutes left!
 We had a busy week on the S&S Blog.  Check out all the new (and maybe some of the old) stuff!
 Seems a little quiet today on Twitter.
  That's just because you keep using your twitter picture for your license...
  Good Morning!  And Good Night!
  Here!  Here!
  Same difference I guess...
  Well, i for one am simply terrified!
  That's a pretty tall order...  We can't all be cool.
 Everyone take cover!!!   is weilding tools again!!!
  Are you in China?
  It's been!  Have a good night!
  but then I guess with a gun in your hand you could take a fine body or work and turn it into fine bodies of work...
  Ok... That last set-up what too easy and could go downhill far too quickly...  Care to try again?
  I guess it depends on who's at which end of the gun now, uh...  The safety is on that thing...  uh... Heidi?  The safety..
  SO, are you "light headed"
  Oh right.  That's the one with the article "The Proud Oral Tradition of Mime"?  And we're back to the lipstick on the gun
  And I know what you must be thinking... all that expensive education...  his parents must be so proud...
  Well, that's your opinion.  What's yours is yours and what's mime is mime...
  Right, but I bet you have trouble keeping things under your hat...
  Whew!  Thanks for letting me know.  It really helps to give me peace of mime.
  True.  I have to watch where I step.  It is a mimefield out there...
  So is it true redheads have more fun?
  It doesn't burn as much as rogaine...
   Hey, thanks for the follow!  I think  has blocked me, so you evened things out...  :)
  Well, it was a wild Tuesday...
   Wow.  Nothing shuts people up like a few bad mime jokes...
  Wasn;t there a haircut game in here somewhere?
 My 100th tweet and I waste it on a lame Mime joke...
  So this has all been a big waste of mime?
  Personally, I would have had the mime wake up with a needle in his stomach.  After all, a stitch in mime saves nine...
  I think you're walking against the wind with this one.
  And so is a punchline...
   Right.  Because I mime is a terrible thing to waste...
  With sharp objects.  When you cut it with dull ones, it is painful and takes too long...  (or maybe there is a picture?)
  Tough room.  One sentence to tell an entire convaluted story...
  And no, I never said there was a second mime in the bed...  Adds to the mystery of it...
  Wait... is this one of those "Don't ask, don't tell things?"
  Alternatively,  "He swore to himself that was the last time he mixed Redbull and Everclear..."
  "Then the mime realized that the lipstick on the gun wasn't his usual color."
  Didn't you hear?  Leno is coming back...
  I hate it when that happens.  Really throws off the rest of your day...
  Have you considered Excedrin?
  AGain, thank you for the mention!  I really appreciate it!
  Thanks for the RT!  I really appreciate it!
   Welcome!  A character interview with Ioan Gwydir is now up on the blog:
  Well, have a good day!
 A character interview with Ioan Gwydir is now up on the blog:
  If you mean by topic, then you but a  the topic and then tweet.
  By other channels, I assume you mean other people's Tweet streams, that would be to place an  before the name.
  Thanks.  That's Marley.  he comes from the Turks & Caicos islands.  We named him, and then later found out about the book...
  Welcome back!  :).
 I ran into an unexpected phenomenon while writing:
  But what if there is coffee on the page?
  Sorry, how do I use your service?
 Not getting anything constructive done on the manuscripts and added a bunch of people to follow.  My work is done here for tonight...
  Well, have a nice evening.  You can read the transcript tomorrow, if you don;t recall our chat in the morning.  ;)
  Yes, it does have it's nice moments too.  They do autumn spectacularly here in Connecticut.
  Oh, and I miss Snuffer's, but that's a another story...
  Well, it's really nice in the spring.  I miss Dallas in the spring and sort of mid fall.
   So I take it that you are at W&M?  (Wren Building?)
  Oh, I do like winter.  It's just the yankees up here overdo it- too much of a good thing...
  I live in New England now.  If there is something I really, really miss, it is heat!  Of course in the summer, well...
  Thanks.  Pass along my best to Big D, I'm a former (or I guess Alumnus) Mustang!!!
    I know I spent a good chunk of tonight on twitter instead of working on the manuscript.  Hope you feel better.
 I'm apparently in the mood to follow a lot of interesting people tonight.
  Survey taken.
  Thanks.  It has been fun, but a tremendous amount of work.  And then the blog seems to take a little more time.  :)
  No.  I rely on the wordcounter in MS-Word for the manuscript.  I am halfway finished with manuscript 2!
 Oh for those few keeping score, the word count on manuscript  Shadow's Light is 56,595!
 Waiting for company.  Why does it always take longer for company to get here than for them to stay?
 New character interview with marcus Severus up on the Blog:
 For once, not sure which Blog entry to put up.  So confused...
  I guess I need to put something thoughtful and insightful there then.  Who am I kidding?  I hope you like it!
  That's the trick isn't it?  Repeat business is what it's all about these days.
  By the way, love the blog!
  Whew!  Thank God.  Okay, I can relax!  :)
 Gah!  I lost a follower!  Who'd I piss off?
 If anybody needs me, I'll be walking Marlley at the park.  I have my cell on me...
 Racing out to pick up the Mother-in-Law from the train.  Oh JOY!!!
 New "About the Author" bio up on the blog if you're curious:
   Hey Lori!  It's John Conway! You or one of your elves should check out the blog!  
  I don't blame you...  I have been procrastinating on twitter for several hours now...
  well, 99% of use are not studying statistics either...
  I was just wondering.  When I take Marley for walkies in the dog park, I don't want problems if a werewolf is out walking himself
   He's adorable!
  Actually, I concur.  It is just in these times, if our biggest fear is poetry, we would all sleep easier.
  I think fear of poetry might be a good thing.  If poetry is our biggest concern these days, I think I could live with that.
 Just a thought.  Do werewolves require dog licenses?  I always wondered...
  Whoa, I did something right?  What did I do right?
 The new "Summon an Article" feature up on the blog:
 There is a new "Summon an Article" feature on the S&S Blog!
  Amen.  It is through the looking glass.
  But doesn't that makes her job easier?  I guess there's no pleasing some people.  :)
  SO?  Isn't that her job?
  Um... I guess I missed the first part of the conversation regarding your last tweet!!!
 I may regret it, but another Dainty Dwarven Delicacies has been posted on the blog:  
 Wow.  It's been a busier weekend that I hoped.  Still, blog addition coming soon, and hopefully a little time to work on the book!
  Thank you for the mention!
  Oh, and thank you for the mention too!
  Thank you for the mention!
  I understand.  I am in the same boat!
 Must walk the dog.  Hope to get a blog entry up today or tomorrow and add a thousand or two more words to the manuscript for SHADOW'S LIGHT
  Congratulations!
  Howdy!  Sorry, it's been a long day today!
  you have my condolences.  I am sorry to hear that.
  Yes it has been.  So glad to be home again!
 Off to the Met to look at medieval weapon designs.  Can't say that the research side is boring...
  You may be on to something there.  Not much makes me as happy as the clickity-click of my keyboard.
 Funny.  When I was a kid I was not a big fan of writing, but now it's my favorite thing to do.  How times change...
 A new character interview is up on the blog: 
  I loved it.  Brilliant reimagining of the character while staying true to the spirit.  And quite a clever script!
  Good to know!
 Another exciting 2,500 words!  Now off to lunch, and perhaps catch the new Sherlock Holmes.  Does anyone think it's any good?
 An hour of writing or an hour of Twitter?  Oh, the terrible choices...
 Brief project update on the blog!  Steady as she goes!!!
 I am working on Book 2.  I am surprised at what spell/grammer check does not pick up when I reread.  Very disappointing.
 New character interview with Lathan the Golden on the blog: 
 New character interview with Lathan the Golden on the blog:
 The first edition of Dainty Dwarven Delicacies is up on the blog: 
  we're crazy because apparently we can not reply to direct messages.  Please follow me so I can send my Email to discuss drawings.
 What is the point of having direct messaging if you cannot reply?
 Arszel I cannot seem to reply to you because you are not following me, but I would like to discuss details.  Can be done over time...
 Looking for fantasy artist to draw some character portraits and a "group portrait" or two. Please Direct Message me for details.
 New character interview (Auric Redbeard)  is up on the blog!!!  
 New design on the blog !  Let me know what you think!
 Remember to check in with the Sword & Sorcery Blog at:
 This is the new twitter blog for the Shadows of Night book series!  It will give updates on progress and distribution as it comes available!
 Perhaps during this blizzard I'll get some more writing done!
  Amen...
 The blog would be  for those of us who have forgetten.  It has been awhile!
 Looks like the blog may even crank up to kick off 2011!!!  Plenty of old material and some new material coming soon!!!
 Hmm...  "New Twitter" and "New Coke" seem to be a little close for comfort.  Not certain I like the new interface...
 Celebrity hotspot in London!!  
 Still working on dusting off the blog and getting everyone back on the same page!
 The Hiatus has been far too long- but unfortunately we must pay the bills...
 Hey we may be returning soon!!!
 Almost back to abnormal after the storm.  NOW the weather is beautiful.
 Must have creative meeting with Marley soon...
 Slowly getting back to abnormal after the storm.  Basement still a mess...
 6 months ago, I submitted a comment card idea about a problem at Disney. Today I get an unsolicted idea letter. Way to listen to customers!
 I thought last week was crazy.  I was wrong.  Nearly four days without electricty.  THAT is crazy.

 Wow, it's been an very busy week with business trips and meetings.  The blog should be updated this week...
 Wow.  Busier week than I had hoped.  Will get blog posted tomorrow if it kills me, and it probably will...
   Hamlet for certain.
 YAY!  I managed to rewrite two chapters in the manuscript and have forged ahead another 3,000 words!  Damn the torpedoes!  Full steam ahead!
   They can have it.
   ow you can have your Sony read any time you want!! :)
   I guess the important question is whose hair is it?
 Granny Redbeard returns!  With an edible recipe!   
 Granny Redbeard returns!  With an edible recipe!   
 Time for the weekly creative meeting with Marley, VP of Creative development on the books.  Granny Redbeard will return very soon too!
 Hmm- it seems like writing these books is a little like producing a movie.  I am re-doing one of the "Sets" and it... 
 Still snowing.  Maybe I can stop procrastinating and get some words on the manuscript...
  Apparently Chocolate Cake.  I guess that's not so bad on a snowy day...
 Just took "what dessert are you?" and got: chocolate cake! Try it ➔ 
 New Trail Rations column up!  Eat what the gang eats, if you dare...   
   Maybe you should refer to them as "Oedipal Candies..."
   Seems like a simply enough request...
  Because "Congress" is the opposite of "Progress"
  I second that...
  Yes.  This is weird.
  Six parts gin/vodka, one part vermouth...  Add an olive or two...
  Legal advice is hard to give in 140 characters.  It depends on what the text is being used for.
  Sharing recipes is good, unless they are Granny Redbeard's recipes...  Then I think it is at least a misdemeanor.
  If it was "legal text," it must be legible to the unaided eye of the average reader.  This would not qualify.
   Not illegal as far as I can tell (I don't know where they go), but bad design.
  Thanks for the mention!
   I guess simplicity is the secret...
   Well, if you sold a book to .05 percent of the population, that would still be sales of about 5,887,120.  I'd take those numbers.
 Arcane Enigmas Column up on the the Blog!   
 Wow!  The S&S Blog goes high-brow academic!
 The academic world cites the S&S Blog!!!... 
  Good luck!
 GAAAH!!!  So busy, I can't even get Granny Redbeard's latest culinary abuse up on the Blog! 
 Damn.  I had two chapters written, signed sealed and on their way to copy editing, and now I have a better idea, I... 
 Back in town!
  No problem!
 Heading out on a business trip.  Will be back on Sunday!
  Thanks again for the retweet!
 The latest and greatest project update!!!   
 Ack!  More white death falling from the sky like little paratroopers of doom!  English translation-  It's snowing again...
  Good to know.  Bit of a drive tonight, even for buttery, maple-y goodness...
  Why do fish swim and birds fly?  Or fish fly and birds swim?
  Yes, I am literally debating driving to the all-night diner to get some.  It's so sad.  It's 12:30 am.  Can;t make up my mind
  Wait...  does that include pancakes?  Pancakes are not evil...
  Oh yeah.  I wonder if Sherwood Diner is open?  We don't have an IHOP anymore.
  Wow, I could go for pancakes about now.  With a lot of butter and maple syrup!
  Thanks for the mention the other day!  Much appreciated!
 Granny Redbeard uses her brains!!! www.swordandsorcerybooks.wordpress.com 
 Time for my creative meeting with Marley.  haven't gotten much done today on the blog or the manuscript...
 About a foot total in snow.  Windy as hell though.
 For those keeping score- officially 9 inches of snow in Westport.  My weather station is saying 10.5.
 Wow.  Officially 5 inches here in Westport, but my little weather station is showing over 6...
 Anyway...  Snow is now falling.  I guess the blizzard is upon us here in New England...
  Well, it helps hide bruising...  Why am I saying this to the several million people that hang out on twitter?
  The jumper cables and rubber mallet probably have something to do with that.  We seem to have wandered down a bad path here.
  Well, evil people need love too.  I guess it comes down to is someone born evil, or is it a conscious choice?
  Well, you never call, you never write...  ;)
   Take a number.  They are saying 12-18 inches in the next 24 hours.  If I ever find out who "They" are, I'm going to punch them.
   I am terified to walk the dog, and it hasn't even started snowing yet!
   Either that or, "Go Postal!"
   I believe it is now, "It'll get there sooner or later.  Probably Later."
   Well, take your finger out of it, and it'll stop hurting...
  Nah, we're out here, terrified of the impending white doom of the blizzard...
   Okay... Just checking...  :)
  You've always had the ability to go home.  Just close your eyes and tap your heels together three times...
   You're not ammo'd up are you?  Do we need to be watching CNN?
  OMG!!!  Should I call in SWAT for a rescue?  I think the Geneva convention bans being snowed in with a 13 year old!
  Welcome to my world...
  Ah...  You have excellent taste.  Today is great day for a little Dylan Thomas.
  I can't wait to see this punchline...
  Yeah, vampires really bite...
   What do you need with money?  You have your daughter home now for nearly two weeks!!!
  Maybe it was a "whirlwind romance..."
  I've heard "The Checks in the mail" before, but it seems this time "the mail is in check"...
  R-Dog?
  Thomas or George???
  Yeah, but it was fun while it lasted.
   Was a mime involved?
  Thanks!
  Procrastinating...
  It just makes landing more of a challenge!
 The Extras have their say:  
 Calling for some serious snow tomorrow and Wednesday.  I hope the power stays on so I can get some writing done...... 
  Who's agenting it?
  I'd love to see more!
  No problem!
 Great.  Snow coming...
 Cool travel videos:  www.conwayconfidential.com
  Ouch.  True, but Ouch...
   I hope you feel better, both physically and mentally.
   But is true nonetheless...
  I'm guessing that they are looking better too...
   Comment away
   
 See how tough you are with this Superbowl Snack from Granny Redbeard!  
  Yes, but how can you see?
 See how tough you are with this Superbowl Snack from Granny Redbeard!   
 WOW!!!  The second straight day of shattering visitor records on the blog!  Am pleasantly surprised!... 
 No snow after all...
  Thanks!  I never thought that this day would come...
 Woohoo!  The big 500!  Okay, I know it's not a huge deal, but I thought I'd acknowledge the milestone anyway...
  Nice country at the top of the Valley!  I spent a fair amount of time out that way...
  You're the one singing...
  Must be nice having your own line at the DMV.  Is it the one by Tysons?  I never got out of there in under two hours...
  Sadly, modesty is not in my repertoire.
  I don't have the legs for them myself...
   Name that tune!
  Well, It'll be a while.  I hope you brought some reading materials!
  Hmm.  Seems we could come up with a quick and easy "Surprise" for dinner that will keep him from making that mistake again...
 Of course, if anyone else wants to add to today's record, check out  
 Just checked the S&S Blog Dashboard, and after a pretty slow week, we set a visitor record today!!!  Thanks... 
 Wow.  Checked the blog.  It had been a slow week but today I set a visitor record.  Thanks everybody!!!
 Up early.  May get some writing done before noon!
 Granny Redbeard has several recipes for this weekend's column and Hazel is bugging me about her new Trail Rations... 
 I'm up too late working on this.  Nearly 70,000 words for SHADOW'S LIGHT and a fair amount of basic mapping for... 
  What's Club 33?
 I put my iPod on "Shuffle" while I write and now I am disturbed.  It is freaky going from Nature sounds to Spinal Tap and then to Mozart...
  Well, I do feel like I have done my good deed for the day...
  Well, at least a life's ambition has been fulfilled on twitter.
  I know the feeling.
  Hallelujah, sister!
  Amen!
  It's been a slow week in general...  I guess people are busier this week than in recent ones.
  It's like an electronic North Korea.  Okay, maybe not that bad, but close...
  Right.  And THEY determine what is spam, not you...
  Yes, it just didn;t seem right.  I certainly wouldn't send an F/U to my agent.  I like her...
  Congrats!!!
  Oh... Follow up... Got it...
  Well, f/u's not a very nice thing to email someone.
 Appreciating the snow.  have some work to do, but will hopefully get some words down this afternoon.
  Well, elves are pretty cool.  Anything humans can do, elves can do better!
  Okay... maybe he's not like me then...  :)
  Glad you like him!  Oddly enough, he is the character I relate to the most I think...
 The S&S Blog characters pick the Super Bowl!!!
 The characters of the SHADOWS OF NIGHT Book Series pick the Superbowl!  
  Are they book PR people?  No offense, but publisher PR people just don;t have the time to be effective very often...
  I think all authors are affected by this mess as the industry changes before our very eyes...
  That works too...  I split time...
  As you wish...
  It seems very painful at the very least...
  Well, you'll get on just fine in New York City...
  Ok, here you go...  Jeez, you're always in such a rush...
 It's about time for my daily blog meeting with "Creative Director," Marley.    www.swordandsorcerybooks.wordpress.com 
   Good to know...
  We all would.  That's just the problem.
  The journey is too quick now, though I know it doesn't seem like it.  Then it becomes a blur.
  Well, real people will enjoy your pearls of wisom more than spammers...
  No.  I try and follow real people who follow me, but I don't generally follow "questionable" profiles
  Oh, take your time.  It is shocking how quickly it comes and goes, and frankly the journey is always more fun...
  No, but there always seems to be a "Fast Forward..."
 Trying to work on the manuscript, but chores seem to keep getting int he way...
  I'm sorry to hear that.  You sound close.
 Satiate your sweet tooth with Granny Redbeard's latest recipe: www.swordandsorcerybooks.wordpress.com 
  Probably not, but when they do, they'll be bowled over.
  Oh, I'm sure you paid for this "free time" dearly...
  What in sweet Jesus, is that???
  So... You're not 1,000% pure?
  An example of what?
  I find the cheese and fruit plate generally is a good compromise...
 Wow, now there is a Facebook Page AND a facebook fan page for the S&S Blog.  I'm so confused! 
 I still have not quite mastered this multi-platform thing.  Snow seems to be melting now...
 I apparently gave the announcement too early on twitter first, but here is the latest on the S&S Blog regarding... 
 So how effective is a dwarven hammer as a weapon?
 Gah!  The cleaning company is coming!  Lots of vacuums and noise!  Must hide to continue writing!
 Just working away and enjoying the snow.  Looks like we have about four inches this morning.
  I thought it was just a "term of endearment."
  Still stepping over bodies?  My god, do you never get enough carnage?
  The implication being that your dad does, but you don't...
  I guess that is what is meant by "jam session."
   "We're all mad here" - the Cheshire Cat.
  Good for you!  Hopefully after my "Conference" with Marley, I'll get some down tonight too...
 Marley and I are going to have a "Writer's conference" at the park.  We'll be back in a little while...
  But you're going to miss the rain and snow they're calling for...
   Apparently you guys don't follow EVERYONE back...
  Yes, but these tips are starting to sound like "John Wayne Gacy's Happy Housekeeping tips."  My blog already has dwarven cookery
  I do.  But putting the bodies out saves a fortune in bleach and lime.  Uh... we may have wandered down a bad path here...
  And the garbage men must be very annoyed with you.  All that extra stuff to cart off...
  I know!  It must wreak havoc with your pedicure and your manolos...  What's a girl to do?
  But you get enough of that at home; why do you need more in your life?
  I guess it depends on the story.  If it is an action piece, no.  If it is a children's book, then yes, they are sickos
  Eh, all you need to know about the world you can learn on twitter.  And maybe PBS or NPR.
  yeah,  set me straight on that!
  Your portfolio is great!  I will send you a note offline.
  You're lucky.  I had to take mine down by court order...
 WOW!  The facebook-Twitter connection works!  Oh, and new SHADOWS OF NIGHT project update!!!  
 New SHADOWS OF NIGHT project update!!!   
 Another day, hopefully another 2000 words on manuscript 2 SHADOW'S LIGHT! 
 Okay, so between Facebook, Twitter and the blog, the SHADOWS OF NIGHT campaign is off and more or less running! 
  Not yet.  I have some history books published out there, but these are the first fiction with my name on them.
  Oh, I have no shame...  But it is all in good fun, at least until the litigation starts...
  That is the right attitude!  (Then again, you have obviously not read the blog...)
  Oh, well, in a way, part of the day job is an online travel magazine and content provider:  www.conwayconfidential.com
  I know.  I'm so confused now...
  No, not yet at least.  I am a writer with a series of fantasy books and a rather silly support blog.
 Thanks   Nothing like getting the ball rolling.  You can say you were there from literally the very beginning!
 It is a little weird to be a fan of your own page... 
 Finally!  The Facebook page is up! 
  Welcvome to my World
 Good Night   Good night Grandpaw!
 You know, if everyone said "Goodnight" to each other on Twitter, we'd almost put the Waltons to shame...
 Want to add to the manuscript, but pretty tired.  maybe I'll have a writer's conference with the puppy...
 Inexplicably, the Fantasy Cookbook on the blog keeps expanding!
  That's worked for me for, well, longer than I will admit on twitter...
  And Just exactly what do you mean?  (Just kidding)
  Always end with a "loose end" that came up earlier in the story, but maybe the PCs did not pay that much attention to at the time
   Hey!  Hope to make your blog someday soon!
  Its appeal eludes me as well.
  Yeah!  It bites!
  Well, You got the "Disloyal" followers... So I guess I can live with that.  I really need to get out more...
  You probably got them from me.  I lost three today...
 Wow, I guess people do hate mime jokes.  I have lost three followers since yesterday!!!
  York, Jersey, Hampshire and Mexico.
  Time flies.  I guess you were having fun...
  Tempus fugit.
  Well, you still have three minutes left!
 We had a busy week on the S&S Blog.  Check out all the new (and maybe some of the old) stuff!
 Seems a little quiet today on Twitter.
  That's just because you keep using your twitter picture for your license...
  Good Morning!  And Good Night!
  Here!  Here!
  Same difference I guess...
  Well, i for one am simply terrified!
  That's a pretty tall order...  We can't all be cool.
 Everyone take cover!!!   is weilding tools again!!!
  Are you in China?
  It's been!  Have a good night!
  but then I guess with a gun in your hand you could take a fine body or work and turn it into fine bodies of work...
  Ok... That last set-up what too easy and could go downhill far too quickly...  Care to try again?
  I guess it depends on who's at which end of the gun now, uh...  The safety is on that thing...  uh... Heidi?  The safety..
  SO, are you "light headed"
  Oh right.  That's the one with the article "The Proud Oral Tradition of Mime"?  And we're back to the lipstick on the gun
  And I know what you must be thinking... all that expensive education...  his parents must be so proud...
  Well, that's your opinion.  What's yours is yours and what's mime is mime...
  Right, but I bet you have trouble keeping things under your hat...
  Whew!  Thanks for letting me know.  It really helps to give me peace of mime.
  True.  I have to watch where I step.  It is a mimefield out there...
  So is it true redheads have more fun?
  It doesn't burn as much as rogaine...
   Hey, thanks for the follow!  I think  has blocked me, so you evened things out...  :)
  Well, it was a wild Tuesday...
   Wow.  Nothing shuts people up like a few bad mime jokes...
  Wasn;t there a haircut game in here somewhere?
 My 100th tweet and I waste it on a lame Mime joke...
  So this has all been a big waste of mime?
  Personally, I would have had the mime wake up with a needle in his stomach.  After all, a stitch in mime saves nine...
  I think you're walking against the wind with this one.
  And so is a punchline...
   Right.  Because I mime is a terrible thing to waste...
  With sharp objects.  When you cut it with dull ones, it is painful and takes too long...  (or maybe there is a picture?)
  Tough room.  One sentence to tell an entire convaluted story...
  And no, I never said there was a second mime in the bed...  Adds to the mystery of it...
  Wait... is this one of those "Don't ask, don't tell things?"
  Alternatively,  "He swore to himself that was the last time he mixed Redbull and Everclear..."
  "Then the mime realized that the lipstick on the gun wasn't his usual color."
  Didn't you hear?  Leno is coming back...
  I hate it when that happens.  Really throws off the rest of your day...
  Have you considered Excedrin?
  AGain, thank you for the mention!  I really appreciate it!
  Thanks for the RT!  I really appreciate it!
   Welcome!  A character interview with Ioan Gwydir is now up on the blog:
  Well, have a good day!
 A character interview with Ioan Gwydir is now up on the blog:
  If you mean by topic, then you but a  the topic and then tweet.
  By other channels, I assume you mean other people's Tweet streams, that would be to place an  before the name.
  Thanks.  That's Marley.  he comes from the Turks & Caicos islands.  We named him, and then later found out about the book...
  Welcome back!  :).
 I ran into an unexpected phenomenon while writing:
  But what if there is coffee on the page?
  Sorry, how do I use your service?
 Not getting anything constructive done on the manuscripts and added a bunch of people to follow.  My work is done here for tonight...
  Well, have a nice evening.  You can read the transcript tomorrow, if you don;t recall our chat in the morning.  ;)
  Yes, it does have it's nice moments too.  They do autumn spectacularly here in Connecticut.
  Oh, and I miss Snuffer's, but that's a another story...
  Well, it's really nice in the spring.  I miss Dallas in the spring and sort of mid fall.
   So I take it that you are at W&M?  (Wren Building?)
  Oh, I do like winter.  It's just the yankees up here overdo it- too much of a good thing...
  I live in New England now.  If there is something I really, really miss, it is heat!  Of course in the summer, well...
  Thanks.  Pass along my best to Big D, I'm a former (or I guess Alumnus) Mustang!!!
    I know I spent a good chunk of tonight on twitter instead of working on the manuscript.  Hope you feel better.
 I'm apparently in the mood to follow a lot of interesting people tonight.
  Survey taken.
  Thanks.  It has been fun, but a tremendous amount of work.  And then the blog seems to take a little more time.  :)
  No.  I rely on the wordcounter in MS-Word for the manuscript.  I am halfway finished with manuscript 2!
 Oh for those few keeping score, the word count on manuscript  Shadow's Light is 56,595!
 Waiting for company.  Why does it always take longer for company to get here than for them to stay?
 New character interview with marcus Severus up on the Blog:
 For once, not sure which Blog entry to put up.  So confused...
  I guess I need to put something thoughtful and insightful there then.  Who am I kidding?  I hope you like it!
  That's the trick isn't it?  Repeat business is what it's all about these days.
  By the way, love the blog!
  Whew!  Thank God.  Okay, I can relax!  :)
 Gah!  I lost a follower!  Who'd I piss off?
 If anybody needs me, I'll be walking Marlley at the park.  I have my cell on me...
 Racing out to pick up the Mother-in-Law from the train.  Oh JOY!!!
 New "About the Author" bio up on the blog if you're curious:
   Hey Lori!  It's John Conway! You or one of your elves should check out the blog!  
  I don't blame you...  I have been procrastinating on twitter for several hours now...
  well, 99% of use are not studying statistics either...
  I was just wondering.  When I take Marley for walkies in the dog park, I don't want problems if a werewolf is out walking himself
   He's adorable!
  Actually, I concur.  It is just in these times, if our biggest fear is poetry, we would all sleep easier.
  I think fear of poetry might be a good thing.  If poetry is our biggest concern these days, I think I could live with that.
 Just a thought.  Do werewolves require dog licenses?  I always wondered...
  Whoa, I did something right?  What did I do right?
 The new "Summon an Article" feature up on the blog:
 There is a new "Summon an Article" feature on the S&S Blog!
  Amen.  It is through the looking glass.
  But doesn't that makes her job easier?  I guess there's no pleasing some people.  :)
  SO?  Isn't that her job?
  Um... I guess I missed the first part of the conversation regarding your last tweet!!!
 I may regret it, but another Dainty Dwarven Delicacies has been posted on the blog:  
 Wow.  It's been a busier weekend that I hoped.  Still, blog addition coming soon, and hopefully a little time to work on the book!
  Thank you for the mention!
  Oh, and thank you for the mention too!
  Thank you for the mention!
  I understand.  I am in the same boat!
 Must walk the dog.  Hope to get a blog entry up today or tomorrow and add a thousand or two more words to the manuscript for SHADOW'S LIGHT
  Congratulations!
  Howdy!  Sorry, it's been a long day today!
  you have my condolences.  I am sorry to hear that.
  Yes it has been.  So glad to be home again!
 Off to the Met to look at medieval weapon designs.  Can't say that the research side is boring...
  You may be on to something there.  Not much makes me as happy as the clickity-click of my keyboard.
 Funny.  When I was a kid I was not a big fan of writing, but now it's my favorite thing to do.  How times change...
 A new character interview is up on the blog: 
  I loved it.  Brilliant reimagining of the character while staying true to the spirit.  And quite a clever script!
  Good to know!
 Another exciting 2,500 words!  Now off to lunch, and perhaps catch the new Sherlock Holmes.  Does anyone think it's any good?
 An hour of writing or an hour of Twitter?  Oh, the terrible choices...
 Brief project update on the blog!  Steady as she goes!!!
 I am working on Book 2.  I am surprised at what spell/grammer check does not pick up when I reread.  Very disappointing.
 New character interview with Lathan the Golden on the blog: 
 New character interview with Lathan the Golden on the blog:
 The first edition of Dainty Dwarven Delicacies is up on the blog: 
  we're crazy because apparently we can not reply to direct messages.  Please follow me so I can send my Email to discuss drawings.
 What is the point of having direct messaging if you cannot reply?
 Arszel I cannot seem to reply to you because you are not following me, but I would like to discuss details.  Can be done over time...
 Looking for fantasy artist to draw some character portraits and a "group portrait" or two. Please Direct Message me for details.
 New character interview (Auric Redbeard)  is up on the blog!!!  
 New design on the blog !  Let me know what you think!
 Remember to check in with the Sword & Sorcery Blog at:
 This is the new twitter blog for the Shadows of Night book series!  It will give updates on progress and distribution as it comes available!
 Perhaps during this blizzard I'll get some more writing done!
  Amen...
 The blog would be  for those of us who have forgetten.  It has been awhile!
 Looks like the blog may even crank up to kick off 2011!!!  Plenty of old material and some new material coming soon!!!
 Hmm...  "New Twitter" and "New Coke" seem to be a little close for comfort.  Not certain I like the new interface...
 Celebrity hotspot in London!!  
 Still working on dusting off the blog and getting everyone back on the same page!
 The Hiatus has been far too long- but unfortunately we must pay the bills...
 Hey we may be returning soon!!!
 Almost back to abnormal after the storm.  NOW the weather is beautiful.
 Must have creative meeting with Marley soon...
 Slowly getting back to abnormal after the storm.  Basement still a mess...
 6 months ago, I submitted a comment card idea about a problem at Disney. Today I get an unsolicted idea letter. Way to listen to customers!
 I thought last week was crazy.  I was wrong.  Nearly four days without electricty.  THAT is crazy.
 I am alive!  It has just been a crazy busy week around the ranch...
 Wow, it's been an very busy week with business trips and meetings.  The blog should be updated this week...
 Wow.  Busier week than I had hoped.  Will get blog posted tomorrow if it kills me, and it probably will...
   Hamlet for certain.
 YAY!  I managed to rewrite two chapters in the manuscript and have forged ahead another 3,000 words!  Damn the torpedoes!  Full steam ahead!
   They can have it.
