 Me 2 RT   If u had babies in the NICU, regardless of length my hats off to you.That was one of the hardest times of my life.
  They induced early, thought I had IUGR but were wrong, it was a mess from the start. All my other babies were homebirths
  Yep. She wasn't sick, just tiny, so I fought all the medical interventions, they tried to ban me, midwife had to mediate
  Spent every day fighting for my wishes, to nurse, no soothers, to even be in there more than every 2hrs. They were mean lol
  Same, anything to get her out of there. I just weaned my 2yr old then ditched him for 2wks to live in the NICU
  Friday! I Wanna Rock Edition!  with  for your Friday Funny!
  Yes, mine  36wks. And as long as they let me nurse too, all I wanted was for her to gain enough to come home lol
  Yeah, I had no say. They didn't even think I could nurse her, "her mouth is too tiny" but I fought them & did anyways
  My preemie was 4.5 lbs, & they wouldn't allow me to solely BF, they gave her supplemental feedings with the tube as well

 Thank God for those golf clubs NOW, eh Sammy??  :-p  
 Remember, the devil CAN drink holy water...maybe it isn't Sam...cause I need an excuse for why he's being such a douche 
 This episode is "anticlimactic", no proper explanations, no tearful reunion, no bond between brothers,no Impala...& no Cas! 
 Maybe this WHOLE THING is a Jin reality....  hopefully it will kill off the new dudes, we only need Sam & Dean!
 Where's the brotherly love here?? I am not liking this...I wanna give Dean a hug  :-(  
 OH NO HE DI'NT!!!!  Kill him Dean!!  
 Did she just say "you were always so amazing in bed"??!! Cause I bet he was!!  
 Say bye bye Lisa...no more apple pie life for Dean!  
 Dean should be pissed...they all screwed him over man! 
  NO!! I'm lost, confused, & seems so fishy...like the LACK of emotion involved..after a frikkin year, & oh yeah, being DEAD!
 Come on, no one thinks it's fishy that there wasn't a tearful deeply touching "OMG you're alive" moment between the boys? 
 The waitress...she was the Jin!!  
 K, I am soooo confused...WTF is going on??!!

  How old is he?? 2yr old molars?? But he's 3 though right, I think? Google Roseola...that really really does spike a fever...
  Rash? Really rosy cheeks?? Slapped face look?? Any teeth due in??
  One of mine never got "sick" with anything, but now & then just spiked really high fever for a few days
  Ah, yes I see...then if they weren't, just watch carefully for other problems
  Have you actually been in to the doctor?
  Try not to worry Mama & just watch for the other changes that can be a warning...happy & eating are good!
  Roseola can spike high like that out of nowhere, but is a very mild virus. And my kids always spiked at night but fine in morn
  Cool tub for sure, stick with Motrin over Tylenol...that's too high but remember a moderate fever is good, fights the infection
 Booth is the perfect man...such a shame he's fictional....

 Me 2 RT   If u had babies in the NICU, regardless of length my hats off to you.That was one of the hardest times of my life.
  They induced early, thought I had IUGR but were wrong, it was a mess from the start. All my other babies were homebirths
  Yep. She wasn't sick, just tiny, so I fought all the medical interventions, they tried to ban me, midwife had to mediate
  Spent every day fighting for my wishes, to nurse, no soothers, to even be in there more than every 2hrs. They were mean lol
  Same, anything to get her out of there. I just weaned my 2yr old then ditched him for 2wks to live in the NICU
  Friday! I Wanna Rock Edition!  with  for your Friday Funny!
  Yes, mine  36wks. And as long as they let me nurse too, all I wanted was for her to gain enough to come home lol
  Yeah, I had no say. They didn't even think I could nurse her, "her mouth is too tiny" but I fought them & did anyways
  My preemie was 4.5 lbs, & they wouldn't allow me to solely BF, they gave her supplemental feedings with the tube as well

 Thank God for those golf clubs NOW, eh Sammy??  :-p  
 Remember, the devil CAN drink holy water...maybe it isn't Sam...cause I need an excuse for why he's being such a douche 
 This episode is "anticlimactic", no proper explanations, no tearful reunion, no bond between brothers,no Impala...& no Cas! 
 Maybe this WHOLE THING is a Jin reality....  hopefully it will kill off the new dudes, we only need Sam & Dean!
 Where's the brotherly love here?? I am not liking this...I wanna give Dean a hug  :-(  
 OH NO HE DI'NT!!!!  Kill him Dean!!  
 Did she just say "you were always so amazing in bed"??!! Cause I bet he was!!  
 Say bye bye Lisa...no more apple pie life for Dean!  
 Dean should be pissed...they all screwed him over man! 
  NO!! I'm lost, confused, & seems so fishy...like the LACK of emotion involved..after a frikkin year, & oh yeah, being DEAD!
 Come on, no one thinks it's fishy that there wasn't a tearful deeply touching "OMG you're alive" moment between the boys? 
 The waitress...she was the Jin!!  
 K, I am soooo confused...WTF is going on??!!

  How old is he?? 2yr old molars?? But he's 3 though right, I think? Google Roseola...that really really does spike a fever...
  Rash? Really rosy cheeks?? Slapped face look?? Any teeth due in??
  One of mine never got "sick" with anything, but now & then just spiked really high fever for a few days
  Ah, yes I see...then if they weren't, just watch carefully for other problems
  Have you actually been in to the doctor?
  Try not to worry Mama & just watch for the other changes that can be a warning...happy & eating are good!
  Roseola can spike high like that out of nowhere, but is a very mild virus. And my kids always spiked at night but fine in morn
  Cool tub for sure, stick with Motrin over Tylenol...that's too high but remember a moderate fever is good, fights the infection
 Booth is the perfect man...such a shame he's fictional....
