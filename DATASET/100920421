   I didn't say it was good or bad. I just happened to have the stat in front of me.
   Of the 120 football teams in Division I-A, OSU is one of only 14 with at least 29 wins in 2008-10.  
    On third-down conversions last year, OSU was fifth in the Big 12 (and better than Texas A&M, Nebraska and Mizzou).
   Big 12 Media: Weeden on J. Randle & J. Smith: "Completely different, but both great backs. Randle is going to play (in the NFL).”
   Big 12 Media: Weeden: "Yeah, we won 11 games and it was great. It was exciting. But we have unfinished business to take care of.”
   OSU could be as good or better than it was in 2010, but a more difficult road schedule could result in fewer victories.
   There are 120 football programs in Division I-A. In 2008-10. OSU is one of 14 teams to have recorded as many as 29 victories.
   Big 12 Media Days: OSU quarterback Brandon Weeden discusses the Cowboy passing game. 
   Perfect summer. Spent time with my son and saw Steely Dan.
   If both teams were to be 100 percent healthy on Dec. 3 (an impossibility), I'd make OSU a 2.5-point favorite.

   OKC Arena energy level is always high. Today, it's heightened considerably.
   My No. 1 is 1971 OU-Nebraska. Today's game definitely on a very short list of the biggest, though.
   Worthy of consideration: Tiger shooting 63 and winning a major at Southern Hills.
   I should specify: We were discussing events that took place on Oklahoma soil.

   Of the 120 football teams in Division I-A, OSU is one of only 14 with at least 29 wins in 2008-10.  
    On third-down conversions last year, OSU was fifth in the Big 12 (and better than Texas A&M, Nebraska and Mizzou).
   Big 12 Media: Weeden on J. Randle & J. Smith: "Completely different, but both great backs. Randle is going to play (in the NFL).”
   Big 12 Media: Weeden: "Yeah, we won 11 games and it was great. It was exciting. But we have unfinished business to take care of.”
   OSU could be as good or better than it was in 2010, but a more difficult road schedule could result in fewer victories.
   There are 120 football programs in Division I-A. In 2008-10. OSU is one of 14 teams to have recorded as many as 29 victories.
   Big 12 Media Days: OSU quarterback Brandon Weeden discusses the Cowboy passing game. 
   Perfect summer. Spent time with my son and saw Steely Dan.
   If both teams were to be 100 percent healthy on Dec. 3 (an impossibility), I'd make OSU a 2.5-point favorite.

   No official confirmation on Everage. Age 30. Member of three Big 12 title teams. Rotated at safety for 2000 national title team.
   Here we go again. Can the Thunder finish this time?
   In 12 minutes, we'll know whether there's a Game 6 on Friday in OKC.
   Through 3 periods, OKC has a 37-32 edge in rebounds. Otherwise, it's a statistical dead heat.
   Maynor enters, joins Westbrook-Harden in the backcourt. Westbrook gets a quick bucket.
    Noise/energy: Maverick fans generate about 30 percent less in the American Airlines Center than Thunder fans do in the OKC Arena.
   Harden, Westbrook, Durant account for 41 of OKC's 54 points.
   Shawn Marion's free throw technique among the least orthodox in basketball history.
   Mavs coach Rick Carlisle, moments ago: "We pulled off a miracle to be in his position."
   Tonight's Game 5 in Dallas: Playoff game No. 17 for Thunder (roughly half of a whole college basketball season).
   Bonus points: A combined 14 by Ibaka and Sefolosha thus far.
   Nine minutes in, Nowitzki has one field goal attempt.
   OKC's energy level quadruples that of Game 3. Durant stunning so far.
   If you had "First Basket: Perkins" in your pool, congratulations.
   Not yet, but it was very low to the ground and definitely not a commercial jet or common small plane.
      I explained what I saw to a man with a military background. Not yet sure what it was.
    I'm not sure I can remember having seen a minus-38 before.
 Did anyone else just see an interesting plane flying very low over south Tulsa?
   Thus far, this qualifies as a spectacular debacle for the Thunder. Limit Nowitzki to 5 points -- and still trail by 21.
   Mark Cuban, Jeff Van Gundy conversing at courtside. Dallas' Jason Terry shoots at one end and Brendan Haywood at the other.
   At $6 per, I wonder how much the OKC Arena collects on beer sales during a Thunder game.
 RT  BREAKING: Bryson Pope, former Jenks star, is leaving the University of Tulsa basketball program. 
   Three fans here sank halfcourt shots to win 60-inch TVs. Meanwhile, Jason Terry was 0-for-2 on threes.
   Game 1: Nowitzki, Terry, Berea had 93 points. Game 2: 48 points.
   Exactly. Three things can happen, and two of them are good.
   Huge 4-point play by Harden. OKC takes 77-76 lead to fourth quarter.
   Dallas gets a basket from its high-low game. Thunder has no high-low game because its big men can't catch the basketball.
   OKC shooting 56 percent from the field and has a 21-15 rebound edge. In 6 quarters vs. Thunder, Nowitzki 31-of-31 on free throws.
   I don't know what your Channel 4  tweet means, but it made me laugh. Made me think of Anchorman.
   The highest seats in the American Airlines Center are approximately one mile from the event floor.
   Westbrook 1-of-1. Durant 1-of-1. Nowitzki 0-of-1.
   And finally, Westbrook must be a force. He's got to knock down the pull-up 17-footers.
   Nowitzki probably gets 30-plus, but make him get it on 25 shots -- not 15.
   OKC keys: Don't get gashed for a combined 45 by Terry and Berea. Don't send Nowitzki to the foul line for 24 attempts.
   Enough of the pregame. Let's play ball.
   Can he play?
   Durant may draw more bad-call fouls than anyone in the league.
   Officially, it's a minus-13.
   Westbrook 1-of-8 from the field. It's probably safe to presume he'll have a better second half.
   This is such a huge gym. The noise isn't as concentrated here as it is at the OKC Arena.
   Ibaka rocks Nowitzki. Nice find by Perkins.
   That would be great, if head slaps counted for anything. If you can't catch an entry pass when you're open, take a seat.
   Nazr Mohammed was born with skillets for hands.
   Jason Terry is uncanny from 3-point range.
   On the day that Harden was born, Jason Kidd was a high school sophomore.
   Durant is melting faces. Already 13 points. The middle-finger pig guy bolts for the men's room.
   Hello, athleticism. Westbrook steal and dunk.
   It takes Jason Terry about four seconds to get his first bucket. Defended by Sefolosha.
   Jason Terry enters for the Mavs.
   Actually, he's wearing way too much Bud Light and a cheap watch.
   Showtime. Game 1 begins. 
   The pig seated immediately in front of our media row seems really proud of his right middle finger. He likes to display it.
   Dallas' American Airlines Center, 6:15 p.m. The calm before the storm.

   I don't think a single fan has left the arena yet.
   In 28 months, Thunder has gone from being a 3-29 loser to a Western Conference finals participant.
 Westbrook, Durant carry Thunder to the Western Conference finals. 
  Westbrook's first career playoff triple-double.
   Westbrook now two points shy of a Game 7 triple-double.
   Memphis shooting 33 percent from the field. OKC, 46 percent.
  Mohammed in for Perkins.
   Too many whistles in this game.

   A 37-year-old Kiss song is played over the PA system, and everyone dances. Memo to current artists: It's time to catch up.
   Collison tip, Durant transition 3 (off Harden steal & dish) give OKC 57-49 lead. Memphis timeout, 3:50 left in the third.
   After the whistle, yanking the ball from an opponent's hands is a punk move.
  This is what happens when teams get sick of seeing each other. It gets chippy.
   Harden now 1-4 on free throws. In a Game 7, every point matters.
   Bench scoring thus far: OKC 12, Memphis 4.
   When Perkins possesses the ball in the low block, there is a collective gasp from the crowd. It usually doesn't end well.
   Correction: Harden enters now.
   In a span of of 10 seconds, Collison gets a stop and a bucket. Harden enters nows.
   Because Jordan is a holy figure.
    Completely agree. In any context, Oklahoma was and is an elite sports state.
   One Thunder fan shouts at Memphis players: "You're scaring the children!"
   OKC Arena energy level is always high. Today, it's heightened considerably.
   My No. 1 is 1971 OU-Nebraska. Today's game definitely on a very short list of the biggest, though.
   Worthy of consideration: Tiger shooting 63 and winning a major at Southern Hills.
   I should specify: We were discussing events that took place on Oklahoma soil.
    I think 1971 OU-Nebraska trumps everything.
   There were several votes for Game 7, and several for the 1971 Game of the Century.
   Conversation topic during pregame media lunch: Is today's Game 7 the biggest sports event in Oklahoma history?
   Kevin Durant on the floor for extensive pregame shooting session.

   6A baseball championship: Broken Arrow leads 4-0. Rams have one hit -- and three errors. Bundy not pitching for Owasso.
   Bundy went seven innings (80 pitches) two days ago. If Owasso is in trouble today, I'd expect to see him make an appearance.
  6A baseball championship: Owasso throwing error results in a run for Broken Arrow. Middle of the second: BA 2, Owasso 0.
 Please excuse my math mistake. Owasso's  doesn't have 505 career strikeouts. He has 595.
 In advance of Saturday's 6A baseball title game, Owasso senior Dylan Bundy has a career pitching mark of 44-3 with 505 strikeouts.
   Who started for Jenks?
   Millen's five: OSU, Arkansas, Nebraska, Boise State, Michigan State.
   Oh, so you think there's a Matt Millen jinx. The Detroit effect.
   Who loses 10 games this season?
     Slow news day. Gotta tweet something. We've got 115 days until college football opening Saturday.
   ESPN College Football Live: OSU on Matt Millen's list of five "surprise national title contenders." So are Nebraska & Arkansas.
   In two home victories during this series, Thunder bench scored a combined total of 101 points.
   Scott Brooks opens fourth period with five bench guys.
   Through three periods, Zach Randolph -- seven points on only nine shots. Durant-Westbrook -- 30 points combined on 24 shots.
    Maybe Collison is more disciplined -- more willing to hold position instead of attempting to block everything.
 RT  I continue to be fascinated with the mysterious powers of James Harden's beard. Even Alastair Crowley would label it  ...
   With six points, Tony Allen is Memphis' leading scorer. Durant with 11 for Thunder.
  OKC already has committed nine turnovers.

   I was stunned when Mayo picked up his 6th on a stop-the-clock foul.
 RT  Not that this helps the debate right now about Westbrook/Durant, but worth noting that Harden had more assists than ...
   OKC is at its best when it's Durant AND Westbrook. Not Durant OR Westbrook.
   For the second time this season, an Oklahoma team prevails in the FedEx Forum.
    I've met Mike. I would hope that we're all better than to wish a flood on a basketball opponent.
   Tasteless. You're better than that.
   Don't look now, kids, but we're creeping up on a FOUR-hour game here.
   Is anyone surprised? I guarantee you, the Grizzlies were't surprised. It's just so predictable.
   First half: Durant attacks the rim, gets to the foul line, sparks rally. At crunch time, he launches contested jumpers.
   With 9 seconds left, that's the best shot you can get out of a timeout? Brutal.
   I can't remember having seen a good team have so many horrible possessions in one important quarter. Way too many jump shots.
   Pacquiao wins, 10th-round stoppage. It's impossible for a 39-year-old to muster his greatest performance.

   It's in today's paper.

 J.J. Berea is just gashing the Laker defense
 Lakers are in trouble. Dallas has rebounded well since its meltdown defeat at Portland.
  Game 1: OKC gets 16 points off the bench. Tonight, OKC has a 48-29 edge in bench points. Maynor, Harden very, very effective.
   Great bench play tonight. The antithesis of Game 1 for OKC.
   Thank you, Z.
   Good line. I wish I had thought of it.
   Courtside at Grizzlies-Thunder Game 2, and we just watched Lirirano complete a no-hitter for the Twins.
   You can't overstate the significance of Thunder vs. Memphis, Game 2. Overcoming an 0-2 deficit would be highly unlikely for OKC.
