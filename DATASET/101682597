 RT  'Lost's' Nestor Carbonell Finds Role on 'Psych' 
  Thanks! Though  is mortified that those old segments are up. Hopefully the show will be a bit less rough!
 We've barely begun to plot out our show, yet we already received a "pilot" of a possible regular segment from a talented fellow podcaster!
 RT  they're remaking "Arthur" with that creepy, gross, unfunny Russell Brand? Why?
  Exactly! Love that show. And the pineapple spotting thing.
   We love "Friday Night Lights." No DirecTV, so we're following along on NBC now. Connie Britton is awesome.
  Not yet! Look for us in August. Though we might experiment early! We're hungry for suggestions on things to check out.
  Haven't caught "Lie To Me," though Tim Roth is a hook. How different is it from "Psych" and "The Mentalist"?
  We like "Dexter." And we've been curious about "Deadwood" since  has been such a big fan!
  Excellent.  is a big "Sons of Anarchy" fan. Go, Katey Sagal!
  Not at all. We liked "West Wing," and really liked Sorkin's other show, "Sports Night."
  You're not the first to recommend "Eureka." Thought it was trying to be too funny, but maybe we'll try it again!
  Can't take "Mentalist" seriously, as fans of "Psych." Like Nathan Fillion on "Castle," though!
  Heard good buzz on "Treme."  really likes "Sons of Anarchy." No premium cable for us, though. DVDs and Netflix FTW!
  We love crime dramas, but never fell for "NCIS." Thought Pauley Perrette was amusing, though!
  Thanks! We watched half a season of "Mad Men," but it didn't hook us like it did many friends. Great style, decent substance.
  Funny question. We mean only age! Can't really romanticize an era we didn't live through. But "Breaking Bad" is on our list.
  Good pick.  definitely loves "Sons of Anarchy." Katey Sagal rocks.
  The U.S. version had fans, but good to know the BBC version is stronger. And many compared it's end to the "LOST" finale.
  We're watching "Dexter," too! Couldn't get into "Mad Men." Wrong demographic? Heard good things about "Breaking Bad."
  Just thought it would be daring to kill off the implied lead protagonist, as was originally conceived. The opposite happened!
 Filling our brains with "Fringe," "The Wire," "The Sopranos," and "Weeds." What other great TV should we be watching or catching up on?
 Congrats to Michael Giacchino on his Oscar win for "Up." One of the best composers working today. He's also behind "LOST."

 RT  'Lost's' Nestor Carbonell Finds Role on 'Psych' 
  Thanks! Though  is mortified that those old segments are up. Hopefully the show will be a bit less rough!
 We've barely begun to plot out our show, yet we already received a "pilot" of a possible regular segment from a talented fellow podcaster!
 RT  they're remaking "Arthur" with that creepy, gross, unfunny Russell Brand? Why?
  Exactly! Love that show. And the pineapple spotting thing.
   We love "Friday Night Lights." No DirecTV, so we're following along on NBC now. Connie Britton is awesome.
  Not yet! Look for us in August. Though we might experiment early! We're hungry for suggestions on things to check out.
  Haven't caught "Lie To Me," though Tim Roth is a hook. How different is it from "Psych" and "The Mentalist"?
  We like "Dexter." And we've been curious about "Deadwood" since  has been such a big fan!
  Excellent.  is a big "Sons of Anarchy" fan. Go, Katey Sagal!
  Not at all. We liked "West Wing," and really liked Sorkin's other show, "Sports Night."
  You're not the first to recommend "Eureka." Thought it was trying to be too funny, but maybe we'll try it again!
  Can't take "Mentalist" seriously, as fans of "Psych." Like Nathan Fillion on "Castle," though!
  Heard good buzz on "Treme."  really likes "Sons of Anarchy." No premium cable for us, though. DVDs and Netflix FTW!
  We love crime dramas, but never fell for "NCIS." Thought Pauley Perrette was amusing, though!
  Thanks! We watched half a season of "Mad Men," but it didn't hook us like it did many friends. Great style, decent substance.
  Funny question. We mean only age! Can't really romanticize an era we didn't live through. But "Breaking Bad" is on our list.
  Good pick.  definitely loves "Sons of Anarchy." Katey Sagal rocks.
  The U.S. version had fans, but good to know the BBC version is stronger. And many compared it's end to the "LOST" finale.
  We're watching "Dexter," too! Couldn't get into "Mad Men." Wrong demographic? Heard good things about "Breaking Bad."
  Just thought it would be daring to kill off the implied lead protagonist, as was originally conceived. The opposite happened!
 Filling our brains with "Fringe," "The Wire," "The Sopranos," and "Weeds." What other great TV should we be watching or catching up on?
 Congrats to Michael Giacchino on his Oscar win for "Up." One of the best composers working today. He's also behind "LOST."
