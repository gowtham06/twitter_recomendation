 RT  A8: Gr8 thing abt our chat today-a reminder 2 talk more about these issues. 
 RT  Q8. Will you talk with your spouse/significant other about these issues? Or, have you already? 
 RT  The ability to fall in love for persons with  is definitely a topic for research!  
   It's got to be hard to legislate love/feelings in a POA. 
 RT  RT  Q5 More powerful than advice to just listen and affirm you are FOR your caregiver friend. 
 RT  I think we can help family caregivers find their voices so they face judgments from others w/ confidence.

 MT  Barry Peterson spoke at CPI's July conf. He is considering a deeper bond w/his wife now that he knows more. 
 RT  It becomes less of a partnership and more selfless. If spouse's needs change, we must as well. 
 RT  Our roles change when were caregiving one day youre her son then youre the parent, its tough 
 RT   Can you tell me a little more rules changing? 
 RT  A4: caregiving is to do what's best for your loved one. May mean letting go of previous marital values 
   I agree. 
 Q4: Haven't reached that point by far, but I can see it becoming a more communal living/exchange of support. 
 RT  Q4. How does caregiving change our definitions of marriage and fidelity? Or, does it? 
    Yes, support can sometimes mean stepping back and letting go. 
 RT   This is a great point: Education of the disease helps ease the pain the disease brings. 
 RT  A3 Some enjoy seeing their spouse happy again, though privately feel great pain. 
 Q3: Would be hard to see, but hopefully balanced w/knowing that person is finding some comfort. 
 RT  Q3. What if your spouse with Alzheimers, living in a facility, seemed to fall in love with another resident? 
  Good question! The discussion can help you feel at peace with whatever decision you make. 
 RT  Do you think its okay to ask your mate early on how they would feel about you dating in the event of illness? 
 RT  A2 Kids have a tough time seeing parents in diff roles. Communication & time > cutting off relationships 
   I agree, super tough choice--and I don't think I'd feel comfortable doing it. Too sad.

 Great to get it all out. RT  I have a 10 yr archive of humor articles about Mom & caregiving, angsty pieces too 
 RT   Whatever helps you, you need to take care of you before you can take care of someone else.
  I agree, support groups are full of ppl going through what you are--place to find help or someone to listen. 
 RT  A little exercise of any type helps. Caregiver's choice - Aikido, Tai Chi, Yoga, Zumba: just get moving. 
 RT  The elder is often impacted by the mood of the caregiver. If caregiver is depressed, negatively impacts. 
 A4: Untreated depression in caregivers will affect the person they're caring for & come back on the caregiver. Nobody wins. 
 RT  Q4. Why is treating depression in family caregivers so important? 
 RT  Q2 Loneliness went away when I started IM online with other caregivers nationwide...I WAS NOT ALONE! 
 Q2: Caregiving can be a full-time job whether paid or not. If you don't take a break from the job, you can't recharge. 
 Very important: RT  Remember, you'll only be able 2 help others if ur able to help yourself. It's ok 2 take time off. 
 RT  Q2. What are the symptoms of depression? How do we know if we are suffering from depression? 
 RT  Caregivers shld give themselves permission to not feel guilty, be kind 2 themselves, not take it personally 
 RT   End-of-life care is a tough reality. 
  I did too, I switched to Tweetdeck just so I could keep up.

 RT  A8: Gr8 thing abt our chat today-a reminder 2 talk more about these issues. 
 RT  Q8. Will you talk with your spouse/significant other about these issues? Or, have you already? 
 RT  The ability to fall in love for persons with  is definitely a topic for research!  
   It's got to be hard to legislate love/feelings in a POA. 
 RT  RT  Q5 More powerful than advice to just listen and affirm you are FOR your caregiver friend. 
 RT  I think we can help family caregivers find their voices so they face judgments from others w/ confidence. 
  *waves to Felecia* 
 MT  Barry Peterson spoke at CPI's July conf. He is considering a deeper bond w/his wife now that he knows more. 
 RT  It becomes less of a partnership and more selfless. If spouse's needs change, we must as well. 
 RT  Our roles change when were caregiving one day youre her son then youre the parent, its tough 
 RT   Can you tell me a little more rules changing? 
 RT  A4: caregiving is to do what's best for your loved one. May mean letting go of previous marital values 
   I agree. 
 Q4: Haven't reached that point by far, but I can see it becoming a more communal living/exchange of support. 
 RT  Q4. How does caregiving change our definitions of marriage and fidelity? Or, does it? 
    Yes, support can sometimes mean stepping back and letting go. 
 RT   This is a great point: Education of the disease helps ease the pain the disease brings. 
 RT  A3 Some enjoy seeing their spouse happy again, though privately feel great pain. 
 Q3: Would be hard to see, but hopefully balanced w/knowing that person is finding some comfort. 
 RT  Q3. What if your spouse with Alzheimers, living in a facility, seemed to fall in love with another resident? 
  Good question! The discussion can help you feel at peace with whatever decision you make. 
 RT  Do you think its okay to ask your mate early on how they would feel about you dating in the event of illness? 
 RT  A2 Kids have a tough time seeing parents in diff roles. Communication & time > cutting off relationships 
   I agree, super tough choice--and I don't think I'd feel comfortable doing it. Too sad. 
 RT  Q1. If your spouse w/  lived in a facility & didn't recognize you, wld you feel okay about dating?

 RT  A7: The kindest question you can ask caregivers: "But how are YOU doing?" They'll be shocked you asked. 
 Great to get it all out. RT  I have a 10 yr archive of humor articles about Mom & caregiving, angsty pieces too 
 RT   Whatever helps you, you need to take care of you before you can take care of someone else.
  I agree, support groups are full of ppl going through what you are--place to find help or someone to listen. 
 RT  A little exercise of any type helps. Caregiver's choice - Aikido, Tai Chi, Yoga, Zumba: just get moving. 
 RT  The elder is often impacted by the mood of the caregiver. If caregiver is depressed, negatively impacts. 
 A4: Untreated depression in caregivers will affect the person they're caring for & come back on the caregiver. Nobody wins. 
 RT  Q4. Why is treating depression in family caregivers so important? 
 RT  Q2 Loneliness went away when I started IM online with other caregivers nationwide...I WAS NOT ALONE! 
 Q2: Caregiving can be a full-time job whether paid or not. If you don't take a break from the job, you can't recharge. 
 Very important: RT  Remember, you'll only be able 2 help others if ur able to help yourself. It's ok 2 take time off. 
 RT  Q2. What are the symptoms of depression? How do we know if we are suffering from depression? 
 RT  Caregivers shld give themselves permission to not feel guilty, be kind 2 themselves, not take it personally 
 RT   End-of-life care is a tough reality. 
  I did too, I switched to Tweetdeck just so I could keep up. 
 RT  RT  Grief must be a big cause of depression. <--Yes. Knowing the end result contributes.
