  My cat's name is Squeaky. Mine is Kim but you can call me Squeaky if you'd like-  call me that all the time. 
    Hi, girls-nice to see you. You both look great. 
  Yes, looks are deceiving--thankfully. MOL 
   Yes, that would be great, thanks. You like the suit? KTF's mum made it for me-she did a great job.
