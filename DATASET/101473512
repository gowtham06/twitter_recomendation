   AAAAAAAA, HALLUCINATIONS!!!!
 BWAHAHAHA, I love this. :) 
 Urg. I have a ticket for an event at 7:00 pm tonight but am tired and not sure I'll stay awake.   
  if he thought it had an excellent chance of being effective, he totally would. Nothing personal about it, just business. 
  there is a TV series I've seen called "How the States Got Their Shapes" about the history (cont) 
 . Hilarious. "Where are you going?" "Oh, just for a hike on Little Cockup." :D
  haha, I just wanted to get home to my books and my own bed and feed my rabbit, and they wouldn't tell (cont) 
  :) RT  Kenley Jansen retired 30 of the 36 batters he faced in July, including 17 by strikeout
  haha, when I was living out East the suburb of Baltimore I lived in was Cockeysville. There is also a Dickeyville nearby.
  and for the next BIO 101 rant - the difference between an octopus and a squid. :D
  it's always for a different reason - I didn't know US pop culture, or they thought my passport was (cont) 
  haha, I have actually had dreams where I was coming home from a vacation in Canada and the border guards wouldn't let me back in.
  I may have to apply for political asylum in Sweden or Norway or someplace. :)
  plus a problem years in the making won't be solved in a couple months. Stupid quick fix attitudes.
  it reminds me of my mom driving through the Illinois farmland with friends and they came to an (cont) 
  so I just turn off the radio when political stories come on and think about something less infuriating. :)
  it makes me want to beat some sense into all of them with a big stick, but that's a hopeless cause I suspect. 
  I was just venting general disgust. They are squabbling worse than my nephew and niece in DC. >:E
 LOVE this! :) RT  RT  I WANT ONE NOW! RT  New shirt design in the works. (cont) 
  ...roads named Ottawa, Nottawa, Canada, and Dangl. :D
  I passed through a town called Amble that had a sign advertising the "Amble Ramble 5K Run/Walk for charity" and...
 Does anyone else notice funny or unusual names of country roads and small towns when driving? 
 Too hot. :( 
  I think they should all have their asking price tattooed on their foreheads. Everyone KNOWS (cont) 
  corrupt money-grubbing self-centered petty small-minded sleazy scumbags. The whole lot of them. >:(
  baby mice can get pricey, though. Especially the shipping.
  if they don't even remember, they might be more inclined to vote "no." Zero emotional connection.
  I'm curious how many of the voting demographic even remember the 1980s in LI because they were too young or lived elsewhere.
  have a safe trip, Al! Enjoy the vacation. :)
   must be a tough league if even the socks need to practice for the season. :D
  he had the attention span of a gnat with ADD. Forgot what you said 20 nanoseconds after you said it. 
  At least there's that. Most people at least accept when you SAY you are being sarcastic. He didn't.  
  uh oh. As big a sarcasm-impaired whackbasket as the guy who thought you hated JV because he was horrible? 
  THIS A MILLION TIMES. IF GIVING UP HOME RUNS PISSES YOU OFF, THEN PITCH BETTER NEXT TIME! And don't whine when the batter wins.
  I have a two-year-old niece with a temper. SHE doesn't pitch a fit like Weaver did! 
  immature? Of course. Extremely hilarious to the point of giving me hiccups I was laughing so hard? YES. :)
   "dealt with?" That sounds slightly ominous, actually. :)
    THIS would be a blast.
  I saw. Congratulations for prompting a response. :)
 Already looking ahead to next semester. I think, if I have the vacation time, I can take both instrumental chem and analytical physics.
   of all the things I've said that someone stole... Hee hee. :D
  ...to the former Loons like Sands and Gordon too. Don't be mean to my guys! :D
  YES! I am in favor of this. Although I am very protective of my favorites. I told the Dodger fans they better be nice...
  some of the M's fans sound like the high humidity has moldered their brains. Also, they better be nice to Casper! >:(
   that's always a problem, though. Same thing as suspending a hockey player who is often a healthy scratch.
  Mind meld! Lol :) 
  that's why I've been following  so I wouldn't forget. :)
  Suspensions are actually a team punishment, and shouldn't be used for petty things. It's overkill imo.
  :) it's such a severe punishment to not permit a team to use a player. Fines are okay, that only penalizes the man himself.
 I hate how one load in a dryer takes so much longer than one load in a washer. 
  I say no. If it's childish, they will get chided by teammates or managers. And it's too (cont) 
  I wonder if it was a four-seam or two-seam temper tantrum? :D
  clearly controlling ball location is easier for Weaver than controlling his temper.
  someone was dropped on their head as a child, methinks.
  haha, I love that comment. "You don't tell him to run, kid."
  It doesn't look right.
  Yeah, still. Bye Casper. 
 He looks so alone there without his Tiger friends.  RT  casper is really a mariner now.  
 I just realized that  was at this game. I hope Sam had a fun time. :)
 Well, that  game was fun. Now to do laundry and a few chores. :)
 SERIOUSLY. PITCH BETTER. RT  If you don't want a guy to admire his home run, don't let him hit a fucking home run.
  he can retaliate fine - just NOT TODAY. 
  you mean  hasn't seen it? That was HILARIOUS (they never got to do a duet, though). : /
   I'll miss Casper.
 Just got home in time for the Tigers. Did not plan it, but just worked out that way. :)
  little over two hours for me. Manageable drive. Was going to see an historic village in Ludington (cont) 
  Muskegon. Went away for a couple days. Nice break. :)
  well, I did get some sleep already, then I woke back up. Trying to get a few more hours now.
  I should definitely get some more sleep. Need to drive home tomorrow. Later today, rather.
   I can't imagine he ever expected a reception like that, but he did such a good job.
   I love stuff like that. Also things like when a hockey player returns to his old team and the fans make him cry.
   Happy thoughts time! How about the standing ovation for Turner after his first start? :) Also, puppies!
   I could never have a job that involved writing up that. Too depressing to think about all the ways to die.
 Bah. Tourist stuff needs to be open earlier on Sundays. It would make my life easier because I'd have less time to kill.
   makes sense. For fans there is just "oh, how horrible" but the team needs to make business decisions after.
  ...and it is presumed lost and those on it presumed dead. There are time limits on that for benefits being paid out.
  ...resolution sounds sensible. It kind of works that way, where at a certain point a search is called off for a missing boat
  hmm. It is an interesting question. Like a small plane going down, or a boat going missing. DL until there is a legal...
    no kidding. That would be horrible. Maybe they'd get special consideration in signing free agents?
  in the offseason a few years ago, I think an NFL player went missing when he went boating. Is that what you mean?
    I would guess those payments are specified in the collective bargaining agreement.
    pretty much every job, even normal ones like mine, have beneficiaries in case of death or disability.
  the worst I've done is mix up my conditioner and shampoo or brush my teeth and extra time.
 Red Sox are clobbering the White Sox. 
  how did you not notice you had socks on before entering the shower?
  taking off socks after stepping out of the shower?
  awww, such a puppy. At least you can count it as weight-bearing exercise, right? :D
  I may take a break from reading for a bit and work on a crochet project instead. Busy hands means NO EATING.
  Gah. I think I'll wait a week after I get home before I step on a scale again. Normally I'm more careful about what I eat. :/
 How did I just eat an entire small pizza?   
  Jimenez might be a better option, but if they asked for too much and didn't permit a physical, the risk is too great.
  makes getting Fister for a lower asking price look better.
   they still don't have anyone as good as Verlander.   
  shouldn't that "WAAAAAHHHHH" be "WAAAAANNNNNKKKK" instead? :D
  it's the kind of series I adore, but I have so little time to read novels I try to avoid new authors. My BIL loaned them to me.
  the series of Harry Dresden novels by Jim Butcher. Just finishing the 6th. Harry is a professional wizard in Chicago. 
 Holy moley. I'm almost finished with my second book in as many days. 
 Even though I have the  game muted, I see Victor and hear   :D
   that's why I LOVE the mute button. 
  still pretty impressive though. :)
 DAMMIT COKE CUT THAT SHIT OUT 
  I'm afraid to ask what Justin Verlander's stats would be in that game. :)
 RT  If videogames were real: Jacob Turner just retired in my Mogul franchise, 309-54 W-L, 2.10 ERA, 11 Cy Youngs.
 I HATE you and your stinky Twins cooties, Torii. >:(
 If I was the mom of someone making his debut, I'd tell the reporter "stfu and let me watch my son without your blithering, asshole."
  that was freaking annoying.
 Saw both ships and the museum I wanted to see, so now I can spend the rest of the day reading. On the balcony when it cools off. :)
  at least it isn't a gross yellowish-gray. That would look disgusting.
  mine is going pure silver. Looks like fine sterling silver wire. It would be cool if it wasn't so depressing. 
  I WISH it was just unruly. I don't have the time to mess around with coloring it.
  my hair is pissing me off. Over the years it's gotten almost black so the silver gray stands out more.  
  I would think if it was going to be Castellanos then the Tigers wouldn't have included Martinez, though. 
 I SEE IT! RT  OH LOOK. DAN HAREN IS THROWING A PERFECT GAME! DOES EVERYBODY SEE THE PERFECT GAME?
 No, Fox morons, SOME of us did NOT lose track of Turner striking out the side. 
 Dan Haren looks like a homeless drug-addled hobo.
   true. But we'll miss him. At least he didn't go to a team I hate so I can cheer for him unreservedly. :)
  Sorry about Casper. :(
 Guess who spent hours walking around in this heat while forgetting to stay hydrated and is now feeling heatsick?  
  not a field trip day today. Nice and quiet, but not deserted. My favorite time. :)
 I forget how much I love art galleries and museums until I actually visit one. :) 
 Another  trade? Great, more time for me to be nervous about the team. >:(
  I don't know either. Figured it was at least polite to give him good luck wishes once it wasn't a rumour only. That bugs me.
  I like Brennan better than Casper better than Dirks. Nothing against him, but...  Yay for pitching help!
  at least it wasn't Boesch. That would have been even worse than  :)
  I planned to be ambitious, but finished one last night, started next. Need to get off my butt and go to the art museum now.
  looks like. Fister and Pauley from Seattle for Furbush, Casper, and Francisco Martinez (3B prospect). 
  I wasted my whole morning reading a novel. Oh, wait...   :)
 Why couldn't it be Dirks instead of Casper?   
  dammit, I wish you could stay a Tiger. Good luck and kick ass, Casper.
 Bah. Overslept and missed breakfast. Just compensate with an early lunch, then.
  more like stressing Detroit out. Or twitter, anyway.
   no kidding. THE INTERNET NEVER SLEEPS. Especially when trade rumours are concerned.
  Tigers won, and Jim Butcher's Harry Dresden novels. The main character is a professional wizard in (cont) 
 Sigh. I chose book over sleep (at least until I pass out)... 
 I am so tired and want to get some sleep - yet I also want to start reading another book. But then I'll sleep too late. 
   I'm just trying to make sense of it all. And failing. I blame it being late. I should be sleeping.
   and logically it might be less in the majors if his pitch count is run up. 12-pitch innings or 38 pitchs.
 Only if it's ice cream, I hope. Don't be crazy. RT  i'm so desperate i'd take a scoop from jim bowden right now
   and then he'll be sent to Toledo instead of AA again? Maybe???
   Maybe, he's just getting a start or two to encourage him? "Good job, kid, here's a taste of the majors?"
   me too. Even if I don't agree with moves I can usually see some logic. This haz no logik.
   well he certainly didn't care about a key spot when Chance Ruffin was thrown in the fire. >:(
   GIVE US SOME ANSWERS OR THE POLO MEETS THIS SEAM RIPPER, DAVE
  you don't sleep nights anyway, Grey. Twitter night shift. :)
  I know, and if they have been adamant about not calling him up before for any reason, why now? WHYYYY? 
   "...is the BEST way of predicting his potential future entire major league career." Freaking INSANE.
   "we think he could be good, but we want to see him throw 5 innings first, because a small sample size...
   even so, say he gets hammered. A team is going to use THAT to determine their plans? Makes NO SENSE!
   seriously. You can't pull up a AA guy, give him one start, and based on that trade him or not. 
   I don't know what is going on, but I don't like this. I don't like this AT ALL.
 I hear that.  RT  Oh dear god, I think I have too much yarn.
 Whelp, thanks to the wonders of the smartphone I registered for classes and paid the tuition. No backing out now.  :)
  :( Traffic jams suck.
   ...since he just needs to be better than Purcey to improve the bullpen, it can't be that hard!
   that would be good. At least relievers are usually easier to find than good starters. And honestly...
   it's REALLY early, but a good sign that he had more command. I hope he keeps it up. 
  blocked it from your mind. Emotional defense against craziness. 
 Woohoo,  win! :D
  also I would point out that he's not IN THE MAJORS RIGHT NOW so her statement is ignorant and incorrect. Also stupid.
  if I were there I would smack her in the back of the head. >:(
  ha, no, although I am having a piece of fudge as a snack. :)
 Heh. :) RT  Nice of the Tigers to give this homeless man a chance to huck baseballs in a blowout game.
  NONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONO!!!!! NO WAY IN FUCKING HELL IS ANY LEAD EVER BIG ENOUGH FOR THAT!!!!
  I love it was on Torii Hunter, after all the times he bedeviled the Tigers with the Twins, too. :D
 HAHAHAHAHAHAHA, so Miggy never hustles, does he? :D 
   True. But I don't like seeing a team trade a young player if they don't have to before they know what he is
  well, yes, but that goes without saying. If you can trade for a bona fide stud starter you give up a lot.
  absolutely. Finding neat things you didn't know you had is like buried treasure. Makes packing or cleaning less of a chore.
  Awww, how nice to still have them. :)
  I think that some people forget he's just a puppy in athlete years. Trading him for an older pitcher wouldn't be smart.
  I know. I just wish people would stop acting like he's older - teams look to trade FOR a young starter, not AWAY! :/
  maybe he doesn't like that he keeps being mentioned in trade talk. :P
  is that stuff that your grandfather saved? :)
  :)
  imagine how I feel for just waking up. Looks like I'll be catching the late replay. Silly naps. : /
 What is it about driving that is so exhausting? It's just sitting in one spot.   
   the "Windy Butt?" Detroit would be the "Motor Butt?" Or New York could be "the Butt Apple" instead.
  it's a side effect of how the bones are formed so they hinge properly. All elbows are boney.
  Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.
  it's like a game of "Six Degrees of Brandon Inge" or something.
   that's assuming Casper comes back up and we don't get stuck with more outfield Raburn. 
  just because you hate him doesn't mean everyone else does. >:(
  one that couldn't throw strikes? That would be easy! 
    that's what I think, too. I can't imagine feeling like taking a walk later - or tomorrow either.
  Muskegon for the weekend. Needed to take a break. :)
  haha, I think it would be like dropping a tac nuke on your diet attempts, though. I couldn't do that to a friend.
  with lettuce, tomato, onion, and "bistro dipping sauce." I think I gained weight reading the menu.
 Okay, definitely room service - the restaurant is packed and happy hour is from 3 to 6 so they are kind of loud.
   dead body could be Penny. Kill two birds with one stone. 
  I'm curious to see what it looks like - but I'm curious to see a grizzly bear without getting too close, too.
  I don't even know how I could fit a sandwich of sandwiches in my mouth!
  no kidding. I didn't realize until I checked in that I haven't eaten since breakfast, but that's still too much food.
  haha, you just want me to tweet a picture, don't you? That would KILL me. :)
 Whoa. The hotel restaurant offers a 1/2 pound burger between two grilled cheese sandwiches in lieu of a bun. O_o 
   me too. But when I saw Verlander before the BYB meetup he didn't have his best stuff. 
 I was going to actually be social and go out to eat, but after a long drive I feel like being a slug. 
  I was on the U505 years ago, and figured it made sense to actually go on a US sub as well.
  Muskegon. The Silversides from WWII. I had to get away for a couple days. 
 The irritating thing about submarines is that it's so hard to show how close and relentlessly utilitarian they are in a photo.
 On the road. And only an hour later than I hoped, which is almost on time for me. :) 
 >:'( RT  XKCD on cancer survival. Correct, poignant.  
  People put their trash out too early? I hate that. Makes the streets smell like hot composting garbage. 
 Now I worry about all the disasters that could befall my house when I am away.   
  they would teach the Vancouver anarchists how to throw a real riot. Like Disco Demolition Night but bigger.
  I agree with this. If they don't have a "fire" they give up at the first setback.   
     now this Mike Maroth talk is making me sad.
  He's one player that I wish so much could share more in later success. Deserved it.   
     I always liked Maroth. Stupid injuries. :/
  clearly your brand of sarcasm is far too sophisticated for their pea-sized brains. 
  oh, good lord, the idiocy is contagious.
   haha, this discussion reminds me of my college friend Emil on a trip to Russia. :)
   extra socks and underwear. Most places if you need a new tee you can get a souvenir one somewhere.
  probably not. With a 2-hour window they cut out anything that doesn't involve run scoring. As (cont) 
   because you will sweat through them and need to change into fresh shirts! Obviously.
   agreed. I have never run out of dry socks or clean underwear on a trip yet. 
  RT  Punto leaves game, Laird leaves game.... *hides BB gun*
  that sounds like me. :) 
  now that the brief shower passed the breeze has picked up and the temp and humidity dropped a ton. Not sticky any more.
  heh, I had to wait until it went long enough that I caught some of the lyrics. Didn't recognize from the music alone. :)
  I did but that's because I have a borrowed paperback and a signed puck in my purse. Rain stopped now so everyone is back out. :)
  Steve Domecus still uses "Back in Black" as his walk up music. :)
 Started raining, but not hard enough to delay the game. Just enough to make people run for cover.
 Ugh. Someone here REEKS of cigarette smoke. I'm allergic so I have to get upwind.
  but they're doing it partly on purposeful obstinance, so maybe like a KHL team?
  too busy chatting. Kids I can understand, they have short attention spans - adults should know better. 
 People who don't even look in the direction of the field at a ballgame annoy me.
  I know. He's just a messy writer. :D also he's growing out his hair so it's really curly now.
 Darren McCarty has a messier signature than Mickey Redmond. I blame being lefthanded. :D 
 Well. At least I finished washing dishes and cleaned the bathroom and fed and watered my rabbit during that  abomination. 
 RTed for the hashtags! RT  On a positive note, Ordonez only left five runners on base in the process.   
   COCKROACHES. I don't know why I keep misspelling it as cockroachers. 
 Pestilence-infested cockroachers! RT  COD VOMIT! SCROFULOUS! RT  This is one of those (cont) 
  seriously, when I saw him here before his promotion he had an outing of 2 innings, 5K, 25 pitches, 20 for strikes.
 Could someone go to Chattanooga and kidnap Shawn Tolleson for the Tigers?  
  that is BS argument. They had Casper on the roster and never felt they HAD to use him!  >:(
 So,  Any thoughts? :) RT   I like the fire option. Lets light him on fire.  
 Fernando Rodney! RT  Let's play a game called relievers from tigers past you'd rather have than said (cont) 
  I vote c) a metric crap-tonne of runs.
   how about "don't trade anyone for a crappy reliever!"  >:(
  there is spending money on a high-quality piece of jewelry, then there is spending on something that turns your skin green.
 PLEASE DFA PURCEY,  - OR SET HIM ON FIRE. 
  I think you can say whatever the fuck you want. :D
  both are just ridiculous. It's insane. :)
 Nice hit, Brennan! :)  
  Flamethrowers work at a distance, though. (paging  !) :D 
  Careful, or  might set you on fire to relieve the tension in the fanbase. :P
  and more comfy chairs than the dugout benches, too.
  They did have a certain permissibility in relationships. More tolerant of some things than in the modern world.
  In our case I blame the heat. Maybe in his, too.
  maybe he's trying to cut back on the smoking and feeling REALLY cranky?

  give me a second and I'll get them out of the box for a photo op. :)
  The Tiger ones from the last two years I gave away, but my friend got tickets to all these games with his son. :)
  oh, the last two years my local Great Lakes Loons have had 6 games where they had Tigers signing… (cont) 
  O is 6 and would break them in record time. Actually, Lindsey isn't too freaky looking, but Sawchuck is a little scary.
  True, J enjoys them a lot too. Problem is that he already has the bobbles because he was at the sa… (cont) 
  ...so he didn't need mine. All my Tiger bobbles went to his boy.
  And the only reason I have those is because it was part of the ticket package and my friend went to the games with his son...
  Bobbles are so creepy. I only have two Red Wings bobbles and they stay in the boxes. (One more giveaway this year, though.)
  cut out the middlewoman. Throw HER out the window. 
 Well. So much for that idea. Lawnmower won't start.   
 Sigh. It won't get any cooler or drier as the day goes on...  : /
  Jeez, I have no idea. I'll need to listen next time he's up at a game I'm attending.
  figured. Slow petty bitches, too, since the deal has been done for a while.
  The new arena will seat 2500. Doesn't Toronto's arena seat 10x as many? Are they really worried or just petty as bitches?
  His defense isn't the best yet - heck, it's only A ball - but he's improved a lot this year. Nice guy. :)
  oh, of course. He'll be the Cleveland version of Luke Scott or something. Still, maybe losing Cubbie cooties will follow him
 WEIRD play. RT  Are you familiar with Rule 7.05(b)? After last night's game, the Loons are.  more here
 Is it the potential overuse of "Fuk you!" puns and comments? : / RT  I am terrified of Kosuke Fukudome.
  I see "Uehara" and read "Uhura" and think "Star Trek" and then want this to happen for giggles. :) 
 Figures that I'd get sleepy just as the sun is coming up.  
    we'll need another vehicle, but if we get enough drivers I don't see why not. :D
    I was impressed when I read that. The NYTimes did a piece on it - he (cont)

   I just got enough of a rumbling to keep me up and some light rain so far. Hard (cont)

  Good luck and safe travels.
 Stupid rumbling thunder keeping me up. So I'm distracting myself with my "Blue Planet" DVDs.

 Hee hee, the Loons broadcasters were talking about Darren McCarty throwing out the first pitch tomorrow and think he should slapshot it. :D
 Jeffrey Shields is pitching very well today. I do not like this because he is the opposing pitcher. 
  It's a "Follow Friday." You use  on twitter to suggest people that your followers should follow. 
  the idea of 3D spam terrifies me beyond reason.
  a Casper Wells hit, bitch? :D
  in that case, ARGH. If I watch I'll just get frustrated and that isn't a good frame of mind when I have a couple days off.
 Debating if I should watch the Tigers replay, since I already know it ends in a loss. : /
  Don't forget you need to DM or email me your address at some point. :)
   Really? Clearly he and READING COMPREHENSION are mortal enemies!!!
  But not a shutout. Weird as hell.
   It's been a year, though. No reason for him to be sentimental about a non-retired number.
 I want to go home! I have too much to do after work (also too much to do at work).  
  haha, perhaps. Lebda just gave the impression of possibly having difficulty stringing together words sometimes. :D
  also, he seems more articulate and thoughtful than the infamous Lebda. So that's a good thing. :)
  at least the hair will eliminate any comparison. He said he's growing it back out. 
  I'd turn him down on the spot just to make the point I won't be pressured by the threat of public attention. 
  haha, I was hoping the same thing. Maybe he can exorcise fans' Lebda-memories? :D
  just don't open BR or MTS. :D

  I think so. They just went ahead in the 6th inning just now. :)
  I'm not sure either, but I LOVED it. I heart Brennan.

 So, Red Wings fans within easy driving distance of Midland - supposedly Darren McCarty will be at the Loons game on Thursday. Just FYI. :)

 Dammit, I hate when something on television sneaks up on me and makes me cry. :')

  I wish I could borrow your mowing robot. 
  I will! Always great to have inside information on the prettiest spots. :)
  Maybe in August. I'm going to the west side this upcoming weekend because I need a break before I snap. >:(
  ooh, I have never been out that direction. Although I haven't gotten to the east side of the state much.
 No. Would it mow too? RT  Is it morally objectionable to create a robot for no other purpose than to weed my garden?
  ooh, pretty. Where were you hiking around today?
 Which makes me feel great considering I will (if I can get the classes I want) be paying tuition this fall. :D 
 Holy cow. I think I just got all my credit cards current (discounting three charges this weekend that I planned for already). Huh.

  At least they have one of the big things to keep them in one spot - committed ownership.  <3 :)
  I'd cry a lot and probably not be able to watch MLB for a long time, if ever again. That would be horrible.
  Me too. Even if there are only a few fans, it still hurts them so much.
 Is it normal to get a book for your nephew and think about keeping it for yourself? 
  Yeah. I can see why, the glory days were so long ago and the recent years have been so very bad, but still sad.
  There was a referendum today on funding for a new arena.  Doesn't look like it will pass. Poor fans. :(
  what a lovely chain link fence that is. :)
  I don't doubt it is a point of comparison, but I doubt it's a very significant one.
  Hmmm. I've seen other pitchers do that, though. Pacing themselves is important if they want to go deep into games.
  not Clayton Kershaw? Although he doesn't have nearly the same dominant fastball, I think.
 Let's go Yankees!     
  Probably because they were invented by Minnesota and their crazy-eyed politicians scare people into allowing them.
  Beckett scheduled next, then Wakefield. 
  You would think. Unless Cleveland's invisible suckage rays affect them and they just roll over and die like a bug.
  Lackey, but it was tied in the 7th when he left. The bullpen projectile vomited up multiple runs.

 Already looking ahead to next semester. I think, if I have the vacation time, I can take both instrumental chem and analytical physics.

  YES! I am in favor of this. Although I am very protective of my favorites. I told the Dodger fans they better be nice...
  some of the M's fans sound like the high humidity has moldered their brains. Also, they better be nice to Casper! >:(
   that's always a problem, though. Same thing as suspending a hockey player who is often a healthy scratch.
  Mind meld! Lol :) 
  that's why I've been following  so I wouldn't forget. :)
  Suspensions are actually a team punishment, and shouldn't be used for petty things. It's overkill imo.
  :) it's such a severe punishment to not permit a team to use a player. Fines are okay, that only penalizes the man himself.
 I hate how one load in a dryer takes so much longer than one load in a washer.

  It doesn't look right.
  Yeah, still. Bye Casper. 
 He looks so alone there without his Tiger friends.  RT  casper is really a mariner now.  
 I just realized that  was at this game. I hope Sam had a fun time. :)
 Well, that  game was fun. Now to do laundry and a few chores. :)
 SERIOUSLY. PITCH BETTER. RT  If you don't want a guy to admire his home run, don't let him hit a fucking home run.
  he can retaliate fine - just NOT TODAY. 
  you mean  hasn't seen it? That was HILARIOUS (they never got to do a duet, though). : /
   I'll miss Casper.
 Just got home in time for the Tigers. Did not plan it, but just worked out that way. :)
  little over two hours for me. Manageable drive. Was going to see an historic village in Ludington (cont) 
  Muskegon. Went away for a couple days. Nice break. :)
  well, I did get some sleep already, then I woke back up. Trying to get a few more hours now.
  I should definitely get some more sleep. Need to drive home tomorrow. Later today, rather.
   I can't imagine he ever expected a reception like that, but he did such a good job.
   I love stuff like that. Also things like when a hockey player returns to his old team and the fans make him cry.
   Happy thoughts time! How about the standing ovation for Turner after his first start? :) Also, puppies!
   I could never have a job that involved writing up that. Too depressing to think about all the ways to die.
 Bah. Tourist stuff needs to be open earlier on Sundays. It would make my life easier because I'd have less time to kill.
   makes sense. For fans there is just "oh, how horrible" but the team needs to make business decisions after.
  ...and it is presumed lost and those on it presumed dead. There are time limits on that for benefits being paid out.
  ...resolution sounds sensible. It kind of works that way, where at a certain point a search is called off for a missing boat
  hmm. It is an interesting question. Like a small plane going down, or a boat going missing. DL until there is a legal...
    no kidding. That would be horrible. Maybe they'd get special consideration in signing free agents?
  in the offseason a few years ago, I think an NFL player went missing when he went boating. Is that what you mean?
    I would guess those payments are specified in the collective bargaining agreement.
    pretty much every job, even normal ones like mine, have beneficiaries in case of death or disability.
  the worst I've done is mix up my conditioner and shampoo or brush my teeth and extra time.
 Red Sox are clobbering the White Sox. 
  how did you not notice you had socks on before entering the shower?
  taking off socks after stepping out of the shower?
  awww, such a puppy. At least you can count it as weight-bearing exercise, right? :D
  I may take a break from reading for a bit and work on a crochet project instead. Busy hands means NO EATING.
  Gah. I think I'll wait a week after I get home before I step on a scale again. Normally I'm more careful about what I eat. :/
 How did I just eat an entire small pizza?   
  Jimenez might be a better option, but if they asked for too much and didn't permit a physical, the risk is too great.
  makes getting Fister for a lower asking price look better.
   they still don't have anyone as good as Verlander.   
  shouldn't that "WAAAAAHHHHH" be "WAAAAANNNNNKKKK" instead? :D
  it's the kind of series I adore, but I have so little time to read novels I try to avoid new authors. My BIL loaned them to me.
  the series of Harry Dresden novels by Jim Butcher. Just finishing the 6th. Harry is a professional wizard in Chicago. 
 Holy moley. I'm almost finished with my second book in as many days. 
 Even though I have the  game muted, I see Victor and hear   :D
   that's why I LOVE the mute button. 
  still pretty impressive though. :)
 DAMMIT COKE CUT THAT SHIT OUT 
  I'm afraid to ask what Justin Verlander's stats would be in that game. :)
 RT  If videogames were real: Jacob Turner just retired in my Mogul franchise, 309-54 W-L, 2.10 ERA, 11 Cy Youngs.
 I HATE you and your stinky Twins cooties, Torii. >:(
 If I was the mom of someone making his debut, I'd tell the reporter "stfu and let me watch my son without your blithering, asshole."
  that was freaking annoying.
 Saw both ships and the museum I wanted to see, so now I can spend the rest of the day reading. On the balcony when it cools off. :)
  at least it isn't a gross yellowish-gray. That would look disgusting.
  mine is going pure silver. Looks like fine sterling silver wire. It would be cool if it wasn't so depressing. 
  I WISH it was just unruly. I don't have the time to mess around with coloring it.
  my hair is pissing me off. Over the years it's gotten almost black so the silver gray stands out more.  
  I would think if it was going to be Castellanos then the Tigers wouldn't have included Martinez, though. 
 I SEE IT! RT  OH LOOK. DAN HAREN IS THROWING A PERFECT GAME! DOES EVERYBODY SEE THE PERFECT GAME?
 No, Fox morons, SOME of us did NOT lose track of Turner striking out the side. 
 Dan Haren looks like a homeless drug-addled hobo.
   true. But we'll miss him. At least he didn't go to a team I hate so I can cheer for him unreservedly. :)
  Sorry about Casper. :(
 Guess who spent hours walking around in this heat while forgetting to stay hydrated and is now feeling heatsick?  
  not a field trip day today. Nice and quiet, but not deserted. My favorite time. :)
 I forget how much I love art galleries and museums until I actually visit one. :) 
 Another  trade? Great, more time for me to be nervous about the team. >:(
  I don't know either. Figured it was at least polite to give him good luck wishes once it wasn't a rumour only. That bugs me.
  I like Brennan better than Casper better than Dirks. Nothing against him, but...  Yay for pitching help!
  at least it wasn't Boesch. That would have been even worse than  :)
  I planned to be ambitious, but finished one last night, started next. Need to get off my butt and go to the art museum now.
  looks like. Fister and Pauley from Seattle for Furbush, Casper, and Francisco Martinez (3B prospect). 
  I wasted my whole morning reading a novel. Oh, wait...   :)
 Why couldn't it be Dirks instead of Casper?   
  dammit, I wish you could stay a Tiger. Good luck and kick ass, Casper.
 Bah. Overslept and missed breakfast. Just compensate with an early lunch, then.
  more like stressing Detroit out. Or twitter, anyway.
   no kidding. THE INTERNET NEVER SLEEPS. Especially when trade rumours are concerned.
  Tigers won, and Jim Butcher's Harry Dresden novels. The main character is a professional wizard in (cont) 
 Sigh. I chose book over sleep (at least until I pass out)... 
 I am so tired and want to get some sleep - yet I also want to start reading another book. But then I'll sleep too late. 
   I'm just trying to make sense of it all. And failing. I blame it being late. I should be sleeping.
   and logically it might be less in the majors if his pitch count is run up. 12-pitch innings or 38 pitchs.
 Only if it's ice cream, I hope. Don't be crazy. RT  i'm so desperate i'd take a scoop from jim bowden right now
   and then he'll be sent to Toledo instead of AA again? Maybe???
   Maybe, he's just getting a start or two to encourage him? "Good job, kid, here's a taste of the majors?"
   me too. Even if I don't agree with moves I can usually see some logic. This haz no logik.
   well he certainly didn't care about a key spot when Chance Ruffin was thrown in the fire. >:(
   GIVE US SOME ANSWERS OR THE POLO MEETS THIS SEAM RIPPER, DAVE
  you don't sleep nights anyway, Grey. Twitter night shift. :)
  I know, and if they have been adamant about not calling him up before for any reason, why now? WHYYYY? 
   "...is the BEST way of predicting his potential future entire major league career." Freaking INSANE.
   "we think he could be good, but we want to see him throw 5 innings first, because a small sample size...
   even so, say he gets hammered. A team is going to use THAT to determine their plans? Makes NO SENSE!
   seriously. You can't pull up a AA guy, give him one start, and based on that trade him or not. 
   I don't know what is going on, but I don't like this. I don't like this AT ALL.
 I hear that.  RT  Oh dear god, I think I have too much yarn.
 Whelp, thanks to the wonders of the smartphone I registered for classes and paid the tuition. No backing out now.  :)
  :( Traffic jams suck.
   ...since he just needs to be better than Purcey to improve the bullpen, it can't be that hard!
   that would be good. At least relievers are usually easier to find than good starters. And honestly...
   it's REALLY early, but a good sign that he had more command. I hope he keeps it up. 
  blocked it from your mind. Emotional defense against craziness. 
 Woohoo,  win! :D
  also I would point out that he's not IN THE MAJORS RIGHT NOW so her statement is ignorant and incorrect. Also stupid.
  if I were there I would smack her in the back of the head. >:(
  ha, no, although I am having a piece of fudge as a snack. :)
 Heh. :) RT  Nice of the Tigers to give this homeless man a chance to huck baseballs in a blowout game.
  NONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONO!!!!! NO WAY IN FUCKING HELL IS ANY LEAD EVER BIG ENOUGH FOR THAT!!!!
  I love it was on Torii Hunter, after all the times he bedeviled the Tigers with the Twins, too. :D
 HAHAHAHAHAHAHA, so Miggy never hustles, does he? :D 
   True. But I don't like seeing a team trade a young player if they don't have to before they know what he is
  well, yes, but that goes without saying. If you can trade for a bona fide stud starter you give up a lot.
  absolutely. Finding neat things you didn't know you had is like buried treasure. Makes packing or cleaning less of a chore.
  Awww, how nice to still have them. :)
  I think that some people forget he's just a puppy in athlete years. Trading him for an older pitcher wouldn't be smart.
  I know. I just wish people would stop acting like he's older - teams look to trade FOR a young starter, not AWAY! :/
  maybe he doesn't like that he keeps being mentioned in trade talk. :P
  is that stuff that your grandfather saved? :)
  :)
  imagine how I feel for just waking up. Looks like I'll be catching the late replay. Silly naps. : /
 What is it about driving that is so exhausting? It's just sitting in one spot.   
   the "Windy Butt?" Detroit would be the "Motor Butt?" Or New York could be "the Butt Apple" instead.
  it's a side effect of how the bones are formed so they hinge properly. All elbows are boney.
  Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.
  it's like a game of "Six Degrees of Brandon Inge" or something.
   that's assuming Casper comes back up and we don't get stuck with more outfield Raburn. 
  just because you hate him doesn't mean everyone else does. >:(
  one that couldn't throw strikes? That would be easy! 
    that's what I think, too. I can't imagine feeling like taking a walk later - or tomorrow either.
  Muskegon for the weekend. Needed to take a break. :)
  haha, I think it would be like dropping a tac nuke on your diet attempts, though. I couldn't do that to a friend.
  with lettuce, tomato, onion, and "bistro dipping sauce." I think I gained weight reading the menu.
 Okay, definitely room service - the restaurant is packed and happy hour is from 3 to 6 so they are kind of loud.
   dead body could be Penny. Kill two birds with one stone. 
  I'm curious to see what it looks like - but I'm curious to see a grizzly bear without getting too close, too.
  I don't even know how I could fit a sandwich of sandwiches in my mouth!
  no kidding. I didn't realize until I checked in that I haven't eaten since breakfast, but that's still too much food.
  haha, you just want me to tweet a picture, don't you? That would KILL me. :)
 Whoa. The hotel restaurant offers a 1/2 pound burger between two grilled cheese sandwiches in lieu of a bun. O_o 
   me too. But when I saw Verlander before the BYB meetup he didn't have his best stuff. 
 I was going to actually be social and go out to eat, but after a long drive I feel like being a slug. 
  I was on the U505 years ago, and figured it made sense to actually go on a US sub as well.
  Muskegon. The Silversides from WWII. I had to get away for a couple days. 
 The irritating thing about submarines is that it's so hard to show how close and relentlessly utilitarian they are in a photo.
 On the road. And only an hour later than I hoped, which is almost on time for me. :) 
 >:'( RT  XKCD on cancer survival. Correct, poignant.  
  People put their trash out too early? I hate that. Makes the streets smell like hot composting garbage. 
 Now I worry about all the disasters that could befall my house when I am away.   
  they would teach the Vancouver anarchists how to throw a real riot. Like Disco Demolition Night but bigger.
  I agree with this. If they don't have a "fire" they give up at the first setback.   
     now this Mike Maroth talk is making me sad.
  He's one player that I wish so much could share more in later success. Deserved it.   
     I always liked Maroth. Stupid injuries. :/
  clearly your brand of sarcasm is far too sophisticated for their pea-sized brains. 
  oh, good lord, the idiocy is contagious.
   haha, this discussion reminds me of my college friend Emil on a trip to Russia. :)
   extra socks and underwear. Most places if you need a new tee you can get a souvenir one somewhere.
  probably not. With a 2-hour window they cut out anything that doesn't involve run scoring. As (cont)

   agreed. I have never run out of dry socks or clean underwear on a trip yet. 
  RT  Punto leaves game, Laird leaves game.... *hides BB gun*
  that sounds like me. :) 
  now that the brief shower passed the breeze has picked up and the temp and humidity dropped a ton. Not sticky any more.
  heh, I had to wait until it went long enough that I caught some of the lyrics. Didn't recognize from the music alone. :)
  I did but that's because I have a borrowed paperback and a signed puck in my purse. Rain stopped now so everyone is back out. :)
  Steve Domecus still uses "Back in Black" as his walk up music. :)
 Started raining, but not hard enough to delay the game. Just enough to make people run for cover.
 Ugh. Someone here REEKS of cigarette smoke. I'm allergic so I have to get upwind.
  but they're doing it partly on purposeful obstinance, so maybe like a KHL team?
  too busy chatting. Kids I can understand, they have short attention spans - adults should know better. 
 People who don't even look in the direction of the field at a ballgame annoy me.
  I know. He's just a messy writer. :D also he's growing out his hair so it's really curly now.
 Darren McCarty has a messier signature than Mickey Redmond. I blame being lefthanded. :D

  oh, the last two years my local Great Lakes Loons have had 6 games where they had Tigers signing… (cont) 
  O is 6 and would break them in record time. Actually, Lindsey isn't too freaky looking, but Sawchuck is a little scary.
  True, J enjoys them a lot too. Problem is that he already has the bobbles because he was at the sa… (cont) 
  ...so he didn't need mine. All my Tiger bobbles went to his boy.
  And the only reason I have those is because it was part of the ticket package and my friend went to the games with his son...
  Bobbles are so creepy. I only have two Red Wings bobbles and they stay in the boxes. (One more giveaway this year, though.)
  cut out the middlewoman. Throw HER out the window. 
 Well. So much for that idea. Lawnmower won't start.   
 Sigh. It won't get any cooler or drier as the day goes on...  : /
  Jeez, I have no idea. I'll need to listen next time he's up at a game I'm attending.
  figured. Slow petty bitches, too, since the deal has been done for a while.
  The new arena will seat 2500. Doesn't Toronto's arena seat 10x as many? Are they really worried or just petty as bitches?
  His defense isn't the best yet - heck, it's only A ball - but he's improved a lot this year. Nice guy. :)
  oh, of course. He'll be the Cleveland version of Luke Scott or something. Still, maybe losing Cubbie cooties will follow him
 WEIRD play. RT  Are you familiar with Rule 7.05(b)? After last night's game, the Loons are.  more here
 Is it the potential overuse of "Fuk you!" puns and comments? : / RT  I am terrified of Kosuke Fukudome.
  I see "Uehara" and read "Uhura" and think "Star Trek" and then want this to happen for giggles. :) 
 Figures that I'd get sleepy just as the sun is coming up.  
    we'll need another vehicle, but if we get enough drivers I don't see why not. :D
    I was impressed when I read that. The NYTimes did a piece on it - he (cont) 
    we could go to Chattanooga and grab Shawn Tolleson. Pure pitching awesome. 
    I saw him his first year A-ball with the Loons. And he's such a great (cont) 
    but that's because Dunn is DUE! He has to break out sometime, right? 
    I want to kidnap Jerry Sands and Dee Gordon too.  :)
    can we brainwash the Dodgers into giving us Kershaw because they can't afford him?  
   I just got enough of a rumbling to keep me up and some light rain so far. Hard (cont) 
   it looks impressive on the radar. I'm just getting the northern edge so it's not much of a storm yet.
  Good luck and safe travels.
 Stupid rumbling thunder keeping me up. So I'm distracting myself with my "Blue Planet" DVDs. 
 I giggle that a tropical storm named Don is heading for Texas, home of  :) 
 Had to text my mom what the heck happened at the ball game on the first play, because it was the strangest thi… (cont) 
 Hee hee, the Loons broadcasters were talking about Darren McCarty throwing out the first pitch tomorrow and think he should slapshot it. :D
 Jeffrey Shields is pitching very well today. I do not like this because he is the opposing pitcher. 
  It's a "Follow Friday." You use  on twitter to suggest people that your followers should follow. 
  the idea of 3D spam terrifies me beyond reason.
  a Casper Wells hit, bitch? :D
  in that case, ARGH. If I watch I'll just get frustrated and that isn't a good frame of mind when I have a couple days off.
 Debating if I should watch the Tigers replay, since I already know it ends in a loss. : /
  Don't forget you need to DM or email me your address at some point. :)
   Really? Clearly he and READING COMPREHENSION are mortal enemies!!!
  But not a shutout. Weird as hell.
   It's been a year, though. No reason for him to be sentimental about a non-retired number.
 I want to go home! I have too much to do after work (also too much to do at work).  
  haha, perhaps. Lebda just gave the impression of possibly having difficulty stringing together words sometimes. :D
  also, he seems more articulate and thoughtful than the infamous Lebda. So that's a good thing. :)
  at least the hair will eliminate any comparison. He said he's growing it back out. 
  I'd turn him down on the spot just to make the point I won't be pressured by the threat of public attention. 
  haha, I was hoping the same thing. Maybe he can exorcise fans' Lebda-memories? :D
  just don't open BR or MTS. :D 
  I thought you were passing out? Not tired? :)
 Stupid Florida. >:( RT  RT  “We cannot elevate nature above people,” says (cont) 
 This is very cool demo of how fast evolution can work. :) RT  It's Dim Up North, So People Need Bigger Brains:  
 Crazy in LOVE with the game! :D RT    baseball makes us all crazy!
   I just want Max to do well so I don't have to yell at my phone for him not to suck.  :)
  ooh, those sound very comfy in hot weather. Good luck! :)
  that's because Justin Verlander >>>>> Jack Morris. :)
  you mean a "regular fan" roundtable? That could be......something. Interesting, perhaps? :) 
 Applies to so much of twitter RT fall asleep? You don’t want to read this then.  by  at 
 This is interesting. My family has learned to read very easily. RT  RT  How does (cont) 
 Good morning, bunny! :) RT  Bunny hops up to see if you're awake yet: 
  Maybe you could mention this and get him some more attention? RT  Hey Wings fans, … (cont) 
    yay for literacy! 
  Well, of COURSE. All right-thinking people should do THAT. :D  
  please don't hate me, either. I understand sarcasm!
  BLOCK THE MORON
  :( At least you saw it the first time, though. :)
 FSD Tiger replay time. :)
  Friends shouldn't make each other cry at all. 
 :D RT  xkcd on 3D printing and spam. One step away from spam being made of actual spam. 
  :)
 Justin Verlander. 
 Tiger fans, please tell me I wasn't the only person yelling "Run, Forest, run!" at the television. 
 Great story. :) RT  Sometimes I wish women were running the show. 
  on BYB the comment "fuck you Juan Pierre" was rec'd so fast it showed up on someone's screen that way.
  I think so. They just went ahead in the 6th inning just now. :)
  I'm not sure either, but I LOVED it. I heart Brennan.
  that was HILARIOUS. What's the opposite of a Boesch bash? :D
  Me, too. At least we have plenty of company - like, EVERYONE IN THE ELECTRIFIED WORLD.
 Interesting piece on circadian rhythms RT  Is it time to overthrow the tyranny of our 24/7 society? 
   >:(
 I WOKE UP FROM A NAP FOR THIS CRAP. STOP SUCKING, 
  a walk would concern me, though.
 Just woke up from a stupid unplanned nap. Sluggish and hungry, but ready for baseball.   :)
  it's how high his BAC was. Regular DUI is a lower BAC - extreme means he was *really* wasted.
   the guy that  nicknamed "Willi Vanilli" or "Vanilla" because he's so boring and nondescript.
  maybe the blue jay liked your garage. You are close to Toronto, right? 
  no need to apologize. I don't expect all to like hockey and baseball and hate football, soccer, and basketball 
  well trolled - I immediately wanted to yell at you. :)  
 RT  New York loves evolution! Check out today's most emailed story in the NY Times-- 
  that's a great sign. :)
 RT  I would watch a reality show that involved  trying to stay alive in Detroit. Like (cont) 
 AND WE DON'T MEAN PURCEY EITHER RT   GET A PITCHER
   not just yet, but soon. It will be the close of a couple more very long, successful (cont) 
  wait until next year. Holmstrom will be unintelligible and Lidstrom's will be very articulate. What a contrast. :)
  I KNOW! HOW TERRIFYINGLY ACCURATE! 
 Not sure if I've lost my mind or am close to finding it. Either way, optimistic. :)
 RTed for the terrifying Brent Morel cartoon. RT  The Wrong Sox are mean to kitten, plus a hot foot: 
  true. Terrorist is probably more accurate anyway, because a madman could be a harmless weirdo, but terrorist implies violence.
 Considering getting a netbook for dragging to campus. Not sure yet. 
    well, he is a madman - but that doesn't mean he didn't draw his inspiration (cont) 
 I so should not be awake right now. Brain too active about everything I need to do in the next month.
  You need to let me know really fast, because the tickets will sell out quickly. I even have an extra puck you can get signed.
  oh, boo. Sorry.
  doesn't sound very final if they keep doing it again.
  can't you come up? A lawn ticket is only $6 and parking is $3. : /
 So, Red Wings fans within easy driving distance of Midland - supposedly Darren McCarty will be at the Loons game on Thursday. Just FYI. :)
  they always have home run fireworks. ALWAYS. It's quite irritating.
 SO LAME. RT  Leland is taking a chance! haha I kill me.
  hey, baby steps. :)
  :)
  At least we can always mock the wankage.  
  
   And we fans thought there would be less wanking with Brad "Wanker" Thomas gone. 
   Kurt uses Tweetdeack - you can set up up to have separate columns for your timeline… (cont) 
  he might still be, but figures that if he acts on it he will just be stuck with them longer. I'd still be annoyed. :)
  it's his only chance to get out. If he plays well enough to get traded he can escape.
  so only his beard will now be referred to as Shea? :)
   holy moley, that's crazy. LOOK WHAT YOU HAVE DONE, MICHAEL! 
  were they actually running WITH SCISSORS?!? Now that would be even more extreme.
