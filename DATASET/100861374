  I got my son a defcon pacifier 2 years ago... :'(
  sarcasm is hard to represent online...
 But we are all indeed humans who make mistakes-- forgiveness is the heart of healing.
 How you treat people matters. Always in the big things, but especially in the little ones. It says much to who you are & what you value.
  what could be wrong about that?
  This is why I am driving up this year, screw them.
 I am driving to Vegas this week, because the  are monsters and I refuse to fly as much as I can.  
 The best errors are the ones where no output is rendered, and no error is actually thrown.  Yay
  I like to think of it as me just being versatile.
   I just worked with some Marines this weekend, and I keep saying: "You tracking with me on this?" "You Savvy?"
 I am worried that will translate to me swearing a bunch in Vegas.
 I have a bad habit of picking up other people's mannerisms when I spend a good deal of time with them.
 ahem...
  SHUT UP AND LEAVE ME ALONE YOU STUPID SPAM BOT
  Well, in that case if you want to give me money I'll make it really easy for you to do so.  I take cash, debit, credit & bank-check
  yah,  sucks about that.
  This is why often nothing gets done :-)
  dang man, I was hoping to have some time and catch up.  Stupid work getting it the way :-)

 Sacrifice is at the heart of every hero story.  What are you willing to give up.
 There are bigger things, of great value, that need people of exceptional caliber to do well.  Are you one? Are you willing?
  They were great guys, taught me about a lot of things to consider in picking gear and why.  I have lots to switch up & test :)
 I also am reminded now, more than ever, how hard they work and what they risk to keep us safe.  God bless our military and their families.
 This weekend has been humbling and great for my spirit.  I am so honored to have worked with 4 fantastic recon marines.
  Yes, long sleeves made a huge difference day 2
 I still hate you 5am.
 So apparently 8 hours in the desert will always equate to a sunburn-- regardless of SPF :'(
 I am exhausted.  Long day of training with great people.
 Dear 5am, you suck.
  I've read  book before.  Might be worth re-reading again as a refresher.
  I think in general I want to start time boxing/measuring my day in hours.  I think thats a good feedback loop.
  I'd try hard, but I get the feeling that  is pretty strong from all the fence jumping :-)
   I wouldn't put money on me.  But for what it's worth, I also cheat.  A lot.
  Do you want to arm wrestle in vegas?
 Misery.  Yay!
 I have become really impressed with a local business here in town lately-- even though my initial opinion of them was not positive
 If anyone has a spare BSidesLV ticket, I have a friend who needs one.  I'd appreciate any help :-)
  couldn't also mean so are they?
  THE AIRPORT GATE! DUN DUN DUHHHHH
  that's what moxie__ gate WOULD say
 I've got 2 ears, 1 mouth, and 10 fingers to tweet about it.
   that thinking doesn't work for this industry-- I have 10 fingers.
  what a great programming paradigm! FDD: Failure Driven Development
  but discovery doesn't help if it's too late-- its better to screw up early and often :-)
 The trick then, is trying to make as many bad decisions up front, and finding out about it quick enough to learn from them :-)
 bad decisions can cause so much wasted time and effort. They also can be the most important step in discovery
  I call them time bombs
  can you tell me EXACTLY what is on your plate? In full detail!
 I saw this vuln and I was like :^) which made me (punch) to see what it'd do.  Well with enough (flex) we ended up (dance) -- ]:)
 I wish I could put animated emoticons into client reports.
  that's the best irony right? You gotta figure some folks getting hand outs from gov are  spending it on Mac products
  because charity is over-rated 
  I suppose that's just proof that if you give nothing to people who are needy you can make a buck or two
 One could argue that hard problems force learning, but this is a fools errand. If you cannot demonstrate basic understanding, dont move on
 Some days, I don't think I am ever going to learn how to learn.  Instead of taking simple examples and building up, I pick hard ones first.
 I've been pushing my body harder than I should be.  As excited as I am for Defcon-- I half already can't wait for it to be over.

  now I am thinking about food
  I just read your tweet, and then typed a response.
  I could use one

 It is the keeping of one foot in the door, which results in the feeling of being torn.  You simply don't know till you know.
 I am not fearful of possibility-- I am certain in my actions until proven otherwise.  I do not care for doubt, I chase truth.
 While the what-if game might appear to be of value, I personally find it a waste of time.  What IS, is important to me.

  as if compromise is always the best thing there is anyways.
 maybe like an hour straight of 0days of various major vendors or something.
 I think next time I give a Defcon talk, I should try and do something sue worthy
  and we wouldn't like you when you are angry.  CORMAN SMASH!
 I crashed another webscanner remotely again.  Once I can reproduce it might even be exploitable.
  we have 0days? Does that help?
   I think most people will be in my talk actually *cough cough* :)
 man, what a productive evening.  I've broken yet another scanner it seems. :-(
  that's cool.  For clarity sake though, you are also not a Zombie either right?

  thats a big bit for twitter...
  I was thinking of this, actually -> 
  <- this article is so wildly off base.  I think I need to stop reading the news.
  yah that's a good point.  Gotta share with everyone... :-)
  But isn't that what taxes ultimately accomplish (though I'd argue charity is a small % of taxation)
  Money isn't the only way to give charity.  Most people forget that.
 just sayin...
 I stand by my tweet-- if anyone wants to give me 1 million dollars to test me :-)
  I suppose, I've not had a million dollars to give away though.  Unless you are offering...
 . Because temptation sucks.
 Maybe it's trite to say, but if I had a million dollars I'd pay off my debts, help my loved ones, and give the rest away.
  instead of actually taking part and doing the work that needs done.
  Christ is for helping people- so he'd want everyone healthy. But he'd also call us hypocrite for shoving the burden to others
  That is a great place to start
  I wrote about this very same topic when the "universal medicare" came out
  but that could be your own bias, experience, and lack of creativity... right? :-)
  You will likely have to eat cat food because your income has been so heavily taxed by others you couldnt pay off debt ;)
  So? Why are the two mutually exclusive?  Profit is bad now too?
 People don't care about results-- they just want to be justified in their opinions.  The results count so very little anymore.
  Not withstanding that where you might be putting money creates opportunity and growth for everyone...
  And? this proves what?
  that is all emotional and squishy, sorry.
  –equatable: 1. characterized by equity or fairness; just and right; fair; reasonable: equitable treatment of all citizens.
   Im sorry but I don't abide much stock in research done out of Berkeley.
  Promising I will be in debt to someone for most of my life-- because it's fair that way.
  or I would, if 30% of my bonus wasn't taken from me
  I'll remember that when I pay off my student loans too...
  I am saying that those who have been given much SHOULD give much in return-- but how they do so should be their right as freemen
  but isn't that sorta what you are doing? You're saying that your experience is that others don't pay enough so they should do more
 man does not need more of this, or less of that-- he needs a spiritual revolution.  he needs Christ.
 Once they do, they almost always become the thing they hated and oppress those who challenge or question.
 Groups who are not in power presuppose they are deserving.  Their actions to gain power, are often equal to rebellion.
  This is why I don't think we are on the same page as "ultimate goal" -- and that  is right
  You've offered no direct experience?  Zillionaires you don't know?
  I've worked in fund raising for non-profits, I've met people who give a whole bunch to support people.
  based on what evidence?  Zillionaires you don't know? I just provided 4 examples and you are telling me they are exceptions
  Nor do I think you actually know the people you are characterizing as villains.
  Im not sure that it's your position to judge others for what they do or don't give.
  Michael Dell is one of the other largest philanthropists in the world too...
  Didn't Warren Buffet plan to give away his entire fortune when he passes away and convinced others to do the same?
  You're going to argue with that?
  Bill Gates is the largest philanthropist in the entire world?
  Should we start taxing student's grades and giving scores to the lowest in the class?
  They've also donated the most.  But what results from their wealth is less important than what they pay the US for it ... right?
  I can't exactly argue with that...
  I don't think we agree on the ultimate goal at all.  not even close.
  but relationships aren't always fair or equal-- taxing people who have prospered is like punishing victims
  It's true we are in this together-- but I am not sure that "we" or"our" representatives care about that on either side.
  and not just huge amounts of mismanagement, debt, and personal salaries
  that is only supposing that my money is being fed back into things that I get benefit from.
  Oh, I don't think I am a part of "they" at all.  They don't represent me, and they barely represent themselves.
  my password IS "your mom".... guess I will need to change it now.
  That's not exactly true-- many wealthy people have worked their way up and still work.
  exactly, I remember my fair share when they take 30% of my bonus they didn't work at all for.
 "TAX THE WEALTHY!" is code for:  Don't work hard and prosper too much or others who didn't will take it from you.
   Um.  The "wealthy" do get taxed, and the Dems have just as much involvement in this madness prior as well.
 This guy left his laptop unlocked w/a picture of him shooting a shotgun as the background.  I wonder if he thinks that's good security...
 And frankly, if that is someone's mom's hijacked system-- so be it.  It's not an excuse if someone tries to shoot w/ stolen gun.
 but if people throwing bricks are a large part of the problem, I think you should do whatever is appropriate to stop the aggressor.
 Your defense still must be strong enough to receive and not be overwhelmed by an attack-- that problem won't ever go away.
 If offensive-countermeasures are a waste of time, then so are defensive ones.
  I'm not calling for a ban either, I just wont let my kids play games like that till theyve some maturity & only  limited time
  Sure, but you are talking about a full fledged sim right? I mean, moving a mouse and keyboard is not the same really...
  meh, I've worked with police trainers and I don't recall them pulling out an xbox for any exercises...
  they might learn strategies from games like that, but pulling a trigger and dealing with a real machine is different.
  which is likely more dangerous, imo.  People need each other and real relationships.
  people don't use games to learn to kill, they use games to learn to disconnect from life.
 Half of the time we're gone but we don't know where.

  I've gotten a small few recently-- reminds me of how it feels (a good thing)
 My goals after defcon include, writing a script per client for testing.  writing people I love a hand written letter.
 I've decided to drown my HP sorrows w/ a crappy movie that wont make me feel anything :-)
 Severus Snape, RIP 
 he endured and resisted-- his bravery outweighs all of potters imo.  Love saved them both.
 Snape's character reminds me of Anikan Skywalker- but instead of turning from the dark side and dying for love, he lived and suffered for it
 I am glad for the movies and the books, just trying to reconcile a character whom deserved the honor.
  Yah, we will see.  I am not sure it matters tho
 To not think of snape as a main character underlies how much the movies diverged from the books.  He is the "anti-hero" of the series.
 Dobbins and Nevel are EASILY the best example of that.
 My wife said, "I thought the main characters would have died"-- but that's because the movie made main characters out of only a few.
 or remus and tonks and why they were so important.
 The death of the twin, for instance, wasn't nearly as tragic given you were only ever shown them as the jokesters.
 I am not really a book is better sorta guy, I just feel especially insulted in this case.  The 7th p1/p2 felt like a diff story.
 But I couldn't wait, and the 7th book had just came out (iirc)-- so I read the whole series in a week.
 To be fair, I decided to read the series after watching the 6th movie.  I had tried to finish the movies first to eliminate bias
  This has nothing to do with Alan Rickman.
  meh-- I don't think it's that easy.  I mean, he did kill dumbledore in the 6th book.
  as it should be.  smart move.
  15 minutes to reveal the largest plot twist of 7 movies? yah... that makes sense ;-)
  I only read in binary, so I can dig it.
  Did I tell you that I cracked an md5 hash w/ last year's t-shirt?
 I wonder how many children of this "harry potter" generation actually read the books...
 Its noble to die for the things you love, but it's a far greater honor to live for them despite your circumstance.
 Severus deserved more than the mere 15 minutes of movie time given.  I am floored by how little his character was respected.
 Just finished watching the last Harry Potter movie.  While I think a well done film, I am very disappointed in many things.
 My mind is funny-- when I read I wish I was working, when I work I wish I was reading.  When I watch tv, I fall asleep.

    How can one do anything before coffee surprises me. It's the first part of every day ;-)
 maybe if there was a private firm who operated more like blackwater for hunting cyber criminals...
  The work doesn't bother me, the process and red tape would.
 I've worked for large corps in fraud units, I can't imagine gov work being very dissimilar.
 You'd have access to lots of important resources, but I bet unlikely to leverage them entirely in meaningful ways. Dunno why I feel that way
 Just based on hiring practices, I'd already suspect that gov work in this area is filled with red tape and would frustrate me.
  I've sent 3 fraud rings to jail, it's one of the most rewarding work I've ever done.
  I guess I meant hacker criminal types, but that was a mouthful ;-)
  I FOUND ONE!
 The gov looks appealing for that type of work, but the hiring process looks like a nightmare.
 I am not really looking for new work, but if I was-- hunting hackers would be very appealing to me.

 Have you ever met someone in person after talking to them online, and just been FLOORED by the difference?  Vice versa?
 I've thought about doing a training program here on formal development patterns and every day use. I dont think enough interest tho
  also, people need training to be prepare for mentorships.  Formal systems might take 2-3 years b4 teacher accepts student.
  I must confess a bias, I feel the web is very impersonal in general.  It's almost surreal the diff between on and off line.
  correct.  training is not mentoring.  Mentoring is a process that takes a long time w/ lots of hands on experience.
  as a general experience note, real mentorship programs don't scale.  The most I've seen is 7 students per teacher  once.
  I've worked in places that tried it, and I still don't think it works the way I'd prefer.
 and no, for the record, I don't believe you can have a relationship with a person because you've read a book.
 I get the desire for online mentorship programs, but having experienced training under a formal teacher for 6 years-- there is a big diff
 It's less about technical knowledge and more about problem solving (and creating).  Education should be relational.
 A hacker university makes sense to me, but I don't think it should be online. There are many things you can only learn shoulder 2 shoulder
  I'd join it.
  or the more right you can be too.  :-)
  maturity doesn't imply educated, however.  I've met many "mature" folks who held bias and angst and fell out of relevance.
 Also-- I made the first desert I've made in years today.  Turned out really well.
  Truth only matters if there is a judge-- in all other cases we are lost in the wind.
 I'd have become a philosophy major-- except I am adverse to drugs and academia (the only two places one goes w/ such a degree)
 Finally-- why trust a person who claims, "I don't have any answers" but then offers them in an endless barrage?
 What I "know" is a small portion of who I am, yet how well I understand that truth is the difference between pride and humility.
 But what good is such knowledge, when we recognize it's of the smallest portion of what can be known?  A drop in an ocean of thought?
 Intelligence is a very odd thing.  Most believe it's related to a concentration of special knowledge.
  I think that I perhaps made my point ;-)
 "No one understands me!" might merely be a reflection of one's inner turmoil. And the most accurate thing one could say about themselves.
 Why is it most people feel misunderstood, instead of realizing they might perhaps miscommunicated?

  and if I have that level of access-- why even bother runtime checking for it when grep for data-access is 100x easier?
  I mean, if I am installing something into my app-- it's surely not black box.

  but that is not always apparent until you've been there.  To know "with in reason" you have to occasionally pass it.
  But because they must learn form and function together, or both will suffer.  Eventually it will be their own expression.
  If I had students, I'd tell them to learn the form until they don't need it anymore.  But not because it's better (p1)

   That feels like a better understanding.  :-)
  So you are willing to be appropriate, in other words ;-)
  and also, since readability is a matter of preference-- I'd argue the code was harder to read as a result.
  we wasted TONS of time to provide "style" features that the customer will NEVER see benefit from
  For instance, I've been on a project where a developer hammered using stylecop guidelines-- which are intended for frameworks
  I don't have to solve everyone's problem with my code-- just the one I was hired to do.  What is appropriate depends on that.
  but you can take that same argument and say-- can marco from brazil and ravi agree that lots of methods == easier to read?
  your functions might be more readable, but your api is likely bloated and no one can follow it-- most will duplicate code.
  and refactoring code (or writing it) w/o a logical purpose of how those additional methods provide generic value is foolish.
  that isn't to say I entirely disagree that methods should do as close to one thing-- but that's not always realistic.

 The best errors are the ones where no output is rendered, and no error is actually thrown.  Yay
  I like to think of it as me just being versatile.
   I just worked with some Marines this weekend, and I keep saying: "You tracking with me on this?" "You Savvy?"
 I am worried that will translate to me swearing a bunch in Vegas.
 I have a bad habit of picking up other people's mannerisms when I spend a good deal of time with them.

 This weekend has been humbling and great for my spirit.  I am so honored to have worked with 4 fantastic recon marines.

 One could argue that hard problems force learning, but this is a fools errand. If you cannot demonstrate basic understanding, dont move on

  <- this article is so wildly off base.  I think I need to stop reading the news.
  yah that's a good point.  Gotta share with everyone... :-)
  But isn't that what taxes ultimately accomplish (though I'd argue charity is a small % of taxation)
  Money isn't the only way to give charity.  Most people forget that.
 just sayin...
 I stand by my tweet-- if anyone wants to give me 1 million dollars to test me :-)
  I suppose, I've not had a million dollars to give away though.  Unless you are offering...
 . Because temptation sucks.
 Maybe it's trite to say, but if I had a million dollars I'd pay off my debts, help my loved ones, and give the rest away.
  instead of actually taking part and doing the work that needs done.
  Christ is for helping people- so he'd want everyone healthy. But he'd also call us hypocrite for shoving the burden to others
  That is a great place to start
  I wrote about this very same topic when the "universal medicare" came out
  but that could be your own bias, experience, and lack of creativity... right? :-)
  You will likely have to eat cat food because your income has been so heavily taxed by others you couldnt pay off debt ;)
  So? Why are the two mutually exclusive?  Profit is bad now too?
 People don't care about results-- they just want to be justified in their opinions.  The results count so very little anymore.
  Not withstanding that where you might be putting money creates opportunity and growth for everyone...
  And? this proves what?

  or I would, if 30% of my bonus wasn't taken from me
  I'll remember that when I pay off my student loans too...
  I am saying that those who have been given much SHOULD give much in return-- but how they do so should be their right as freemen
  but isn't that sorta what you are doing? You're saying that your experience is that others don't pay enough so they should do more
 man does not need more of this, or less of that-- he needs a spiritual revolution.  he needs Christ.
 Once they do, they almost always become the thing they hated and oppress those who challenge or question.
 Groups who are not in power presuppose they are deserving.  Their actions to gain power, are often equal to rebellion.
  This is why I don't think we are on the same page as "ultimate goal" -- and that  is right
  You've offered no direct experience?  Zillionaires you don't know?
  I've worked in fund raising for non-profits, I've met people who give a whole bunch to support people.
  based on what evidence?  Zillionaires you don't know? I just provided 4 examples and you are telling me they are exceptions
  Nor do I think you actually know the people you are characterizing as villains.
  Im not sure that it's your position to judge others for what they do or don't give.
  Michael Dell is one of the other largest philanthropists in the world too...
  Didn't Warren Buffet plan to give away his entire fortune when he passes away and convinced others to do the same?
  You're going to argue with that?
  Bill Gates is the largest philanthropist in the entire world?
  Should we start taxing student's grades and giving scores to the lowest in the class?
  They've also donated the most.  But what results from their wealth is less important than what they pay the US for it ... right?
  I can't exactly argue with that...
  I don't think we agree on the ultimate goal at all.  not even close.
  but relationships aren't always fair or equal-- taxing people who have prospered is like punishing victims
  It's true we are in this together-- but I am not sure that "we" or"our" representatives care about that on either side.
  and not just huge amounts of mismanagement, debt, and personal salaries
  that is only supposing that my money is being fed back into things that I get benefit from.
  Oh, I don't think I am a part of "they" at all.  They don't represent me, and they barely represent themselves.
  my password IS "your mom".... guess I will need to change it now.
  That's not exactly true-- many wealthy people have worked their way up and still work.
  exactly, I remember my fair share when they take 30% of my bonus they didn't work at all for.
 "TAX THE WEALTHY!" is code for:  Don't work hard and prosper too much or others who didn't will take it from you.
   Um.  The "wealthy" do get taxed, and the Dems have just as much involvement in this madness prior as well.
 This guy left his laptop unlocked w/a picture of him shooting a shotgun as the background.  I wonder if he thinks that's good security...
 And frankly, if that is someone's mom's hijacked system-- so be it.  It's not an excuse if someone tries to shoot w/ stolen gun.
 but if people throwing bricks are a large part of the problem, I think you should do whatever is appropriate to stop the aggressor.
 Your defense still must be strong enough to receive and not be overwhelmed by an attack-- that problem won't ever go away.
 If offensive-countermeasures are a waste of time, then so are defensive ones.
  I'm not calling for a ban either, I just wont let my kids play games like that till theyve some maturity & only  limited time
  Sure, but you are talking about a full fledged sim right? I mean, moving a mouse and keyboard is not the same really...
  meh, I've worked with police trainers and I don't recall them pulling out an xbox for any exercises...
  they might learn strategies from games like that, but pulling a trigger and dealing with a real machine is different.
  which is likely more dangerous, imo.  People need each other and real relationships.
  people don't use games to learn to kill, they use games to learn to disconnect from life.
 Half of the time we're gone but we don't know where.

 My goals after defcon include, writing a script per client for testing.  writing people I love a hand written letter.
 I've decided to drown my HP sorrows w/ a crappy movie that wont make me feel anything :-)
 Severus Snape, RIP 
 he endured and resisted-- his bravery outweighs all of potters imo.  Love saved them both.
 Snape's character reminds me of Anikan Skywalker- but instead of turning from the dark side and dying for love, he lived and suffered for it
 I am glad for the movies and the books, just trying to reconcile a character whom deserved the honor.
  Yah, we will see.  I am not sure it matters tho
 To not think of snape as a main character underlies how much the movies diverged from the books.  He is the "anti-hero" of the series.
 Dobbins and Nevel are EASILY the best example of that.
 My wife said, "I thought the main characters would have died"-- but that's because the movie made main characters out of only a few.
 or remus and tonks and why they were so important.
 The death of the twin, for instance, wasn't nearly as tragic given you were only ever shown them as the jokesters.
 I am not really a book is better sorta guy, I just feel especially insulted in this case.  The 7th p1/p2 felt like a diff story.
 But I couldn't wait, and the 7th book had just came out (iirc)-- so I read the whole series in a week.
 To be fair, I decided to read the series after watching the 6th movie.  I had tried to finish the movies first to eliminate bias
  This has nothing to do with Alan Rickman.
  meh-- I don't think it's that easy.  I mean, he did kill dumbledore in the 6th book.
  as it should be.  smart move.
  15 minutes to reveal the largest plot twist of 7 movies? yah... that makes sense ;-)
  I only read in binary, so I can dig it.
  Did I tell you that I cracked an md5 hash w/ last year's t-shirt?
 I wonder how many children of this "harry potter" generation actually read the books...
 Its noble to die for the things you love, but it's a far greater honor to live for them despite your circumstance.
 Severus deserved more than the mere 15 minutes of movie time given.  I am floored by how little his character was respected.
 Just finished watching the last Harry Potter movie.  While I think a well done film, I am very disappointed in many things.
 My mind is funny-- when I read I wish I was working, when I work I wish I was reading.  When I watch tv, I fall asleep.

    How can one do anything before coffee surprises me. It's the first part of every day ;-)
 maybe if there was a private firm who operated more like blackwater for hunting cyber criminals...
  The work doesn't bother me, the process and red tape would.
 I've worked for large corps in fraud units, I can't imagine gov work being very dissimilar.
 You'd have access to lots of important resources, but I bet unlikely to leverage them entirely in meaningful ways. Dunno why I feel that way
 Just based on hiring practices, I'd already suspect that gov work in this area is filled with red tape and would frustrate me.
  I've sent 3 fraud rings to jail, it's one of the most rewarding work I've ever done.
  I guess I meant hacker criminal types, but that was a mouthful ;-)
  I FOUND ONE!
 The gov looks appealing for that type of work, but the hiring process looks like a nightmare.
 I am not really looking for new work, but if I was-- hunting hackers would be very appealing to me.

 Have you ever met someone in person after talking to them online, and just been FLOORED by the difference?  Vice versa?
 I've thought about doing a training program here on formal development patterns and every day use. I dont think enough interest tho
  also, people need training to be prepare for mentorships.  Formal systems might take 2-3 years b4 teacher accepts student.
  I must confess a bias, I feel the web is very impersonal in general.  It's almost surreal the diff between on and off line.
  correct.  training is not mentoring.  Mentoring is a process that takes a long time w/ lots of hands on experience.
  as a general experience note, real mentorship programs don't scale.  The most I've seen is 7 students per teacher  once.
  I've worked in places that tried it, and I still don't think it works the way I'd prefer.
 and no, for the record, I don't believe you can have a relationship with a person because you've read a book.
 I get the desire for online mentorship programs, but having experienced training under a formal teacher for 6 years-- there is a big diff
 It's less about technical knowledge and more about problem solving (and creating).  Education should be relational.
 A hacker university makes sense to me, but I don't think it should be online. There are many things you can only learn shoulder 2 shoulder
  I'd join it.
  or the more right you can be too.  :-)
  maturity doesn't imply educated, however.  I've met many "mature" folks who held bias and angst and fell out of relevance.
 Also-- I made the first desert I've made in years today.  Turned out really well.
  Truth only matters if there is a judge-- in all other cases we are lost in the wind.
 I'd have become a philosophy major-- except I am adverse to drugs and academia (the only two places one goes w/ such a degree)
 Finally-- why trust a person who claims, "I don't have any answers" but then offers them in an endless barrage?
 What I "know" is a small portion of who I am, yet how well I understand that truth is the difference between pride and humility.
 But what good is such knowledge, when we recognize it's of the smallest portion of what can be known?  A drop in an ocean of thought?
 Intelligence is a very odd thing.  Most believe it's related to a concentration of special knowledge.
  I think that I perhaps made my point ;-)
 "No one understands me!" might merely be a reflection of one's inner turmoil. And the most accurate thing one could say about themselves.
 Why is it most people feel misunderstood, instead of realizing they might perhaps miscommunicated?

  its one of the few shows he likes and watches-- I wont take that away due to my disagreement with portions of it.
  He enjoys it, and can't comprehend why I dislike the show.  I am sure all he sees are the trains and biffs & bashes
 I am thinking about shutting down my public twitter after defcon.
 I am finding it harder and harder to watch Thomas the Tank Engine w/ my kids.  This show is kinda nuts.
  wow... I mean.. just wow
  if you care nothing for acting, dialog, and hate yourself-- it could be a good movie ;-)
  yah I watched the cartoons and loved it-- this... not so much
 15 minutes into the last airbender movie-- gotta say, pretty horrible movie.
   I think it'd be great if articles did both!
 makes me wonder-- do  agents get pat downs before they can go to work?
 I thought the  was down for this sorta stuff?  
 interesting, my son was playing on this computer and I found a search for numeric cryptogram solvers...

 It is a matter of hubris to have merely read a book and believe that makes you qualified.

 I greatly dislike creating an account in a website I will use maybe once.
  the problem is that even if I got rid of everything, I'd still have soo much school debt I'd be upside down.
 There are days where I wish I could sell all my material possessions and start over very simply.
  can you tell me any other vulns active on your network?  Also, may I have your public IP?
  maybe the dude with the big eyeball is freaking me out..
  I think being able to correlate attacks to lines of code is cool-- but the post itself is just weird.
  and if I have that level of access-- why even bother runtime checking for it when grep for data-access is 100x easier?
  I mean, if I am installing something into my app-- it's surely not black box.
  You know I think you are awesome right?  Because I'm not sure that post makes any sense to me at all.
 For the sake of simplicity, I think people in the industry who share similar sounding names should highlander it out.

  but that is not always apparent until you've been there.  To know "with in reason" you have to occasionally pass it.
  But because they must learn form and function together, or both will suffer.  Eventually it will be their own expression.
  If I had students, I'd tell them to learn the form until they don't need it anymore.  But not because it's better (p1)

   That feels like a better understanding.  :-)
  So you are willing to be appropriate, in other words ;-)
  and also, since readability is a matter of preference-- I'd argue the code was harder to read as a result.
  we wasted TONS of time to provide "style" features that the customer will NEVER see benefit from
  For instance, I've been on a project where a developer hammered using stylecop guidelines-- which are intended for frameworks
  I don't have to solve everyone's problem with my code-- just the one I was hired to do.  What is appropriate depends on that.
  but you can take that same argument and say-- can marco from brazil and ravi agree that lots of methods == easier to read?
  your functions might be more readable, but your api is likely bloated and no one can follow it-- most will duplicate code.
  and refactoring code (or writing it) w/o a logical purpose of how those additional methods provide generic value is foolish.
  that isn't to say I entirely disagree that methods should do as close to one thing-- but that's not always realistic.
 IMO, the best interview process I've taken part in was  - and I didnt even get the job. They demonstrated how deeply they care.
