 Wait, What? RT  Anyone else looking forward to the relaunch of the Honda Civic this fall?
  Where's the chatroom? Is there no chat for tonight's show?
 This was my day so far.. 
  and what type of logic is he using if any
 Chrysler & Maserati becoming best buddies once again -  
  can I consider myself a group? Cause I'm all in
 Yeah, CItroen kicking Ford's but ;-) RT  Ah man Doran beat Tanner 
 Holy shite, Toby Moody is doing to commentary for Rally X.. Consider me interested 
 Who ever came up with the Joker lap for the RallyCross & Rally X... should be punched in the throat 
 Yes, I would watch that RT  I'd like to see these XGames rally drivers compete against actual rally drivers.
  It's ok.. I saw the news a couple hours after you announced it.
  Thats awsome..
  But in my defense, I didn't know the news till I finished talking to 
  I thought they would use magic dust ;-) 
  Congrats 
  But you thinking with too much common sense.. Lets think about this a little harder ;-)
 RT  I wrote a few words about manliness and our day today, if you're interested:  
   ;-)
  thank good Börger.. (Would say sir, but I know you dislike that) ;)
  I know. I'm happy for you & wish you the best of luck..
 I kind of sad to see  say farewell, but I wish  the best of luck..
  please solve this problem.. Someone needs to
  dude, seriously I can't.. Another time for sure.. Sorry man 
  Sorry Adam, I didn't realize that was you.. I was busy on the phone with one  Raincheck for now?
 RT  Review - 2011 Jeep Patriot Latitude 4X4: How You Enter The Jeep Family  
  Well it helps the 500 doesn't have an awful transmission the ForTwo has
  Can you get a car for a  run? 
  But the Challenger's big problem is still its weight.. 
  I can understand that.. They have released new engines this year which do improve performance 
  That's why I like the Challenger.. it's retro in many apsects.. even handling 
  Challenger, still holds true to its muscle car roots 
 “ This is the Nissan GT-R $760 7-piece toolkit - ”

 Ok, the impossible has happened: I actually laughed at one Adam Corolla's jokes on The Car Show 
   aww, I love when you give me ideas..
  thats understandable
 RT  "the Germans do muscle better than the Americans" Love it!  At which point I stare and wonder what you been drinking
  I understand there's people who don't to facebook. But we're glad people do comment on stuff either on twitter or FaceBook
  That was in the early 2000's if I remember

  Night David ;) 
  I'm going to need see more of Top Gear America before I make a decision 
 Yeah I'm seeing it as well RT   It's a crazy episode, but I'm starting to see the 3 gel.   
  I felt stupider after watching the Season 2 opener 
  I agree with you and I wish they would go back.. But unfortunately it doesn't look like it will happen 
  I know, I always wanted Speedvision & when we got it, it was around the time of the Speed and Nascar change 
 After reading that I threw up a little bit in mouth RT   Matt Farah drives you wild with desire? lol 
  So does a small minority of people as well.. We need to talk about speed sometime 
  Well, I want to punch Adam Corolla in the mouth & Matt Farah drives me a bit crazy 
  It was better than the Season 2 premier of  
 RT  - A good race car driver is someone who can drive fast consistently, protect equipment, and fears just enough 
  I know, the opportunity was there and I jumped on it ;) 
 RT  I'm hoping to drive a Jaguar one day.  I like luxury and reliability. 
  No, I don't its the car.. Its the person behind the wheel 
   I would love to attend any driving school.. would help greatly 
  I am sorry to hear you did own at one time a Toyota Echo.. 
  Yes, I know I can become a better driver.. I just need to learn how 
  I consider myself an Ok driver.. I don't everything about driving at the moment 
   I think what this proves is, a problem big or small can cause someone to shun a brand 
 Bingo RT   knowing what you don't know 
  I'm going to be while before I have an answer 
 Espically the 96 one RT   I love me some Brougham 
  Simple: LOOK AT ME, LOOK AT ME.. I'M DRIVING AN EXPENSIVE CAR 
 Good Night RT  night  
 Same.. The only one RT  Koenigsegg Agera . . .droooooollll  
  umm, who do they invest with and where can I sign up? 
 Spaceballs, not Superballs RT   Super balls... what? 
  I don't know. I will gladly take a 200 & Sonata and compare them both 
  Okay, I'm fine with that.. 
  But given the choice of Sebring or Sonata.. I'm taking the Sonata  
  Figure out what Hyundai is and continue working on quality 
 Let us note that it was 10:02 when Nick said this ;-) RT   you can get a Challenger SRT8 for that 
  The Genesis R-Spec is a good start.. Good engine, but you can't really justify the $46k price tag they're asking for 
  No, I think we are beginning to see some cracks in their armor 
  What year is your friend's Tuscon? 
  I think they're over reaching bit.. The Equus was getting high marks, but has been quietly getting dinged for problems 
   I think it could be Kia that could possibly fit the Honda mold..  Possibly Ford  
  I'm wondering the same thing.. is this just a blip or can they continue it  
  You cannot use the Canadian Meteor as being the first car on the moon 
 It can be done.. I think RT   will LS9 run on anti-matter?  Probably 
  While they're at it.. Bring back Mercury ;) 
  No, I had the chance to tour around where they launched the rockets 
 I don't remember the first shuttle I ever saw, but I do remember seeing the last one 
  I believe so, its getting to that point.. 
 Like Lawn Tractors :D RT  - NOTE:  LIVE is more than about cars, we enjoy all sorts of toys ;)
  Yeah, the S80.. Imagine that 
  Needs to have Turbos, AWD, manual option, wild color options.. 
   
 Yes RT  - Are you aware that Volvo is one of the most successful automakers in Touring Car Racing? 
  I loved the S60R and its a wagon brother - the V70R 
  Hold on, I need to yell at someone who doing it again 
  Uh yes, but I very excited.. very much 
  brings attention to it 
 hell yeah RT  - Are you a fan of the Polestar C30 Concept? 
  and by therapy, he means telling me about  every day ;) 
 yea hat time is important ;) RT  It feel like AGES since Ive hat time for     LETS go!
   and here I thought I was the only one trying to figure this out..
  I'm all for go fish.. can't play yooker 
 Tonight on  LIVE,  hosts this week,  goes on another rally, and  hides under a desk
  So in other words; Maserati is like Saab where they forget to design a new model until the next decade
 for 5 seconds, at most RT  GM and the UAW are on the same page in contract talks. Think that'll last? 
 RT     The M cars are not considered supercars. They need to remain practical. 
 Pamela Anderson & the Mercedes-Benz E350 Convertible.. What? -  
  So, something the V12 Diesel from the Audi R8 Concept 
  yes, yes I would 
  Yes, I would buy a diesel performance car 
   If that was to evar happen.. I would so buy that in heartbeat.. Wonder how much the bloke had to drink that night
 I don't know why.. But I like this tuned XJ from Japan -  
 Need to watch one still RT  24 Hours of LeMons in CT (lotsa pics) got me thinking...  
  I don't think that could fit into the luggage   
  I wished there was a sarcasm font for twitter.. Never want to drive a red car since its attention getter
  I understand, just let me know when you can..
 Nope, not at all RT  Nothing quite says pull me over than a red slk at then end of the month

 woah RT  RT  For your eyes only!  
 RT  My first review! 2011 Chevrolet Impala LS Review  
  hey, I just dropped of a DM to you.. get back to me when you get the chance
  That's not shameful. I loved the IS, especially the SportCross..  
 RT   Not the Lambda. They're 4500lbs+. That's too much heft for a petrol turbo four.  
   I think Ford's Zeta is Lincoln at the moment 
  There have been rumors about Ford doing it.. but Ford isnt saying a thing  
  Don't know, I like the current one.. Going to wait and see 
  Yeah, I'm happy the 2.8T is gone as well.. It was a disappointing engine 
 I had no chance to begin with.. This guarantees it RT  Some people are always on twitter. Do they ever get laid?

  like hills? 
  See, now your making want to take a hemi powered car to test your theory.. ;) 
 Who are they listening to? RT  Honda is finally listening to us! Ridgeline SPORT!
  is he getting coffee again?  
 RT    The "common sense" option was discontinued due to lack of demand.
 Woah, that was deep RT  Its more than a car, its the memories it helps you create.  
  It's a toss up, some days I would want the manual.. Other days give me the automatic
   No, I don't want to try the smart since I'm worried a breeze would take me away
  Well for someone like me who doesn't know how to fully drive a stickshift, the Automatic is a viable option
   I don't know, I would actually like to try Auto  500
  Hey, I sent you a few DMs.. let me know if you got them

 Hi  's Boss
 Before the C30, Volvo had a range of small vehicles.. Just none of them came over to the US -  
 Thanks :) RT   make sure to check out  Wed nights and  Thur nights, it's where the actions at.
 Finally, GM confirms Cruze Diesel for the US. Cue happy dance. -  
 RT  Make sure you've read this post:  I heard  and  are helping me write a f ...
 Yep RT    If I got a super car I would go wild, it's not something you buy with thought.
  I would take a BMW 335d or Mercedes-Benz E350 Bluetec for the weekend.. 
  Night dear
   That's next weeks show ;) 
  I can't stand Farah a lot with his vids, on this show.. its bearable 
 Yes.. RT  I know I'll get flak for this, but is it wrong to watch the show just for Farah? :) 
 So am I RT  I will say that I am rooting for the TopGearUSA team to improve this season! 
  I like Sally, now Corolla on the other hand.. I want to hurt him 
 We need John Sally RT   You think Salley Should be on the show?? Explain. 
 I'm busy drinking said beer ;) RT   You owe me a beer! ;) 
  I didn't have enough space for all of zeros needed ;)) 
 174 Variants and counting RT   Yes, Benz offers the most. Porsche with just 911 variants beats us all! ;) 
  That's why I think Mercedes has the head start, I know BMW and Audi will pass them in due time 
   Well look at this way: Mercedes has the largest lineup.. BMW and Audi heading towards that 
 I think Mercedes has a head start RT   Audi vs. BMW. Who can be the next GM first? 
 bahahaha RT  “ Someone find me a nice Sebring convertible for cheap :)  What? You are strange!
 I wished BMW had another diesel to bring over  
  Coming from the man who said last he was crying when the M5 crashed in Ronin ;)) 
 I'm tearing up here RT  us too! RT  Ah...the 335d - gonna miss it! 
 I know, should be more ;) RT   480?! That's it? ;)  
 I don't know, have to see it in other colors RT  Thoughts on the menacing DTM BMW M3!  
 woah RT  OMG, I am here for  Get out!
 RT  We made it! Golden, CO 2200 miles on this  can we do it over again!   
 You can have any color on the M3 DTM as long it is in black 
  Hey Manny.. Aww, thank you, you're to kind 
  Hey Ty, Enjoying the heat ;) 
 Evening 
  The Cayenne
 Breath  just breath 
  Well, Chrysler did offer a good price.. 
  You lost me again ;-P 
  I don't think I couldn't have even could have gotten that.. Maybe a ride int 200 Convertible ;)  
  and by that; do you mean yourself and  wearing wigs & standing next to  ;)  
 I can't believe you're complaining about this ;) RT  I think some people just like to complain.
  - From the  Facebook Page.. Amazing things you can do while in Park
 RT  Best road sign ever:  
  No problem, enjoy reading the site
  Thanks for the RT :) 
  Yeah, I know.. thats the $100,000 question.. What is everyone going to do 
  Oh, you just reminded me Picture of the three original members of  live 
 Thanks for the congrats:         
  Well, Land Rover is testing hybrids and I expect diesels will play a big role 
 Now, Its the  Open Mic time.. Talk about whatever you feel like
 Thanks to everyone who participated tonight, I was worried but you guys came though. 
 Remember, like us on facebook at   RT if you already have.. We want more people joining us
 Well, I think this wraps up  Live for tonight. Thanks to everyone who put up with me and the problems I had earlier.
  really? Luxury manufacturers are behind?  
   Yeah, the successor to the Veyron - 2,000 HP ;)
  Ask and ye shall receive -  
 How will truck & luxury automakers manage to meet government CAFE regulations while delivering the power their customers demand? 
  So you wouldn't use an extension cord to charge it? ;) 
  Well, the Urea injection and the particulate filters add alot of cost 
 Would you consider the purchase of an electric car? 
  I think I need to talk to you about domestic made fuels.. since you know a lot.. ;-) 
 I love diesel, but with stringent emission standards the US has and the weight of equipment needed. I can't see it becoming bigger 
  I'm asking it again.. 
 Hydrogen, Ethanol, Diesel, Propane -  Will they play a role for the future? 
 Yes, I want the experience of driving a semi truck in my car ;) RT  Dont forget 12 speed gearboxes.... 
  you just brought up my next question: Are alternative fuels still a option? Why or why not? 
 Like  said earlier RT   the search for MPG while making 450HP lead BMW to tri-turbos! 
 What technology do you see automakers using to meet consumer demand and CAFE regulations in the future? 
  Cliff notes version: Autoblog took a Chevy Cruze Eco, Honda Civic Hybrid, and VW Jetta.. Cruze Eco was deemed favorite 
  You do realize I have a link  -   
 Were you surprised by Autoblog's findings? Do you disagree? What car would you have deemed king of the pump? 
  Look at Europe, Alfa is niche brand there as well.. Expecting the same here 
  We'll get to that shortly 
 Last week,  recently compared 3 fuel sippers that were propelled in 3 distinct ways.   
  Yeah, thats what I'm wondering here.. 
  Thanks for joining us 
 As consumers and lawmakers demand cars be more efficient the search for MPG will take many different routes 
 When its on fire sure RT   better than a 458?  Nothing looks better...nothing 
 RT  And finally to our last topic - Attack of the Fuel Sippers 
 Hmm, some very interesting thoughts on Alfa.. Glad I'm not the only one worrying about it.. 
  Depends which Ferrari we are talking about 
  I know... 
  I know.. It makes me sad to see that.. I don't think anyone at Fiat knows what Alfa Romeo is supposed to be 
  No one knows except at Fiat.. I bet we will find out in due time 
  For a time, The BTCC and WTCC did have Alfa's racing 
  That's the question, I would focus them at BMW/Audi/Mercedes 
 So that will add what, 5 sales? RT   make a ute?  
 Anyone...   
 So,  participants.. What does Alfa need to do to succeed in the US?
  That's a good question, I've heard they would sell them at Chrysler dealers 
 Is this the right lineup for the US? Will it succeed? 
 4C is their launch car in late 2012.. Followed by the Giuletta, Guila, and a SUV.. 
  I actually have seen a Giulietta running around and I agree with that statement 
 Looking at Alfa's US lineup and missing dates left and right, Do they have a chance? 
  I think you mean Guila, since that's the 159's replacement 
  No, but do know about the problems.. I love that car. 
 Now, Alfa has announced the dates* for their return, starting with the 4C -  
  Hey, I love that pile of junk 
 Since 2003, Alfa Romeo has promised us they would be making a return.. only to miss those dates 
 The last Alfa Romeo sold in the US was the 164 Sedan in 1995 
 Onwards to our next Topic - The mysterious case of Alfa Romeo 
  oooh, exciting 
   I thought Senna was ok.. I think I needed to know a bit more of F1 History to get some of the story 
  You mean the one that would be damaged in one scene and some how magically repair itself in another 
 Where else can a car influence be seen in our culture? And where do we see our culture influence cars? 
  I think we're going to be talking about that in few weeks :) 
   I think I have seen pics of 58 Plymouth, very nice car 
 Hawaii Five-0, I wanr a 74 Mercury Marquis so bad 
 Cars often play an important role in Television as well (say what?) What Television shows have had strong car influences? 
 Wheres the ban button? ;) RT  Friday. Kicking in the front seat, sitting in the back seat, which seat can I take? 
  I was wondering who be the first to mention that ;) 
  You're worrying me again 
 Is there a music video you remember for the cars featured in it? 
 Music has been written about cars since the beginning of the auto industry. What are some notable songs featuring cars? 
  Everything.. Nah, just kidding. We're on the topic of Cars and Culture.. 
  Yes it was Roger Moore, Esprit would make another appearence in For Your Eyes Only 
  you would think he would get points for that   
 What do you think about product placement in movies when it comes to cars? Is there a point where the movie becomes an ad? 
 Well it was nice knowing you ;) RT   You rooted the frog car?? U and I are done!! ;)  
 First car comes to mind, Christine.. Plymouth 
 What cars were characters in a movie in their own right? 
  Really, I root for the Peugeot 605 thats chasing it ;) 
  French Connection was a pontiac? 
 Movies often are remembered more for their chase scenes than the actual movie. What chase scene cars do you remember in movies? 
  I thnk you mean cough.. Where's Charlie's twitter? ;) 
 Cars play an important role in our culture whether we realize it or not. 
 Alright, moving along to the next Topic: Cars and Culture 
 Ok, So The Car Show has some good and some bad points (John Sally).. Most everyone like it 
  We're finishing up on Speed's The Car Show 
  Well, Nick if it was a Challenger that had the Dodge logo that went up and down.. I know you'll be all over it 
 Ok, last question: The Car Show or Top Gear USA? 
  Yeah Nick, that's a feature on Rolls 
   Isn't that next weeks show? 
  Neil, I loved.. He did a good job with the Rolls test and wished he poured some Grey Purpon on Corolla 
  You know, I'm not too keen on Matt Farah as a host.. I need to watch more before I decide 
 Okay, now that I'm back.. What did you think about the segments? Loved the Rolls test and GT3.. Other parts concerned me 
 Is that a Steven Segaull film? RT  on general car note, bad guys drive a GN in the movie "Out For Justice" 
  Dude, thanks for joining us till your phone died 
  Wait, really? Are you ok? 
 Which is so awsome to happen during  just to let everyone know
 Sorry everyone, my internet konked out on me 
 I'm going to surprise everyone, I loved John Sally.. Now Adam Corolla, I wanted to throat punch 
 So, who watched it last week & what were your thoughts

  I think they are people at Cadillac who believe in that.. (But its a small minority) 
   Yeah, Cadillac is going in 15 different directions at once.. Some focus could help that 
 Yes, I know its a repairable.. But I would buy and repair it..   
 Yes.. For now RT   is having success this year with some great cars. Is it eating Caddy's Lunch? 
  If I had to, Volt.. Otherwise, I'm looking at other vehicles 
  Oh, I know that very well.. I don't kid when I say  in MI 85% and possibly higher are vehicles from the Big 3 
  But look, I know there a few dealers outside of Michigan that have Volts on their lots.. I'm just a special case 
   I don't wear the rose colored glasses (I'm a harsh critic of GM when I need to be) 
  Well, where I'm at, I see dealers that only have 1 volt.. and thats the demo unit 
  I believe so, dealers were only getting a few at a time 
  Well, you did improve the HP by a tenfold ;)
  Yes, More Volts going into dealerships means more sales 
    
 uhh..  RT    I'd pet the Fiat lol  
 If it comes out 1st RT  Could the 4.5TD "MiniMax" be a true game changer in the half ton market?  
 I think the word you're looking for is antique RT    this is what I hear, int feels dated

 Let us note that it was 10:02 when Nick said this ;-) RT   you can get a Challenger SRT8 for that 
  The Genesis R-Spec is a good start.. Good engine, but you can't really justify the $46k price tag they're asking for 
  No, I think we are beginning to see some cracks in their armor 
  What year is your friend's Tuscon? 
  I think they're over reaching bit.. The Equus was getting high marks, but has been quietly getting dinged for problems

 Yep RT    If I got a super car I would go wild, it's not something you buy with thought.
  I would take a BMW 335d or Mercedes-Benz E350 Bluetec for the weekend.. 
  Night dear
   That's next weeks show ;) 
  I can't stand Farah a lot with his vids, on this show.. its bearable 
 Yes.. RT  I know I'll get flak for this, but is it wrong to watch the show just for Farah? :) 
 So am I RT  I will say that I am rooting for the TopGearUSA team to improve this season! 
  I like Sally, now Corolla on the other hand.. I want to hurt him 
 We need John Sally RT   You think Salley Should be on the show?? Explain. 
 I'm busy drinking said beer ;) RT   You owe me a beer! ;) 
  I didn't have enough space for all of zeros needed ;)) 
 174 Variants and counting RT   Yes, Benz offers the most. Porsche with just 911 variants beats us all! ;) 
  That's why I think Mercedes has the head start, I know BMW and Audi will pass them in due time 
   Well look at this way: Mercedes has the largest lineup.. BMW and Audi heading towards that 
 I think Mercedes has a head start RT   Audi vs. BMW. Who can be the next GM first? 
 bahahaha RT  “ Someone find me a nice Sebring convertible for cheap :)  What? You are strange!
 I wished BMW had another diesel to bring over  
  Coming from the man who said last he was crying when the M5 crashed in Ronin ;)) 
 I'm tearing up here RT  us too! RT  Ah...the 335d - gonna miss it! 
 I know, should be more ;) RT   480?! That's it? ;)  
 I don't know, have to see it in other colors RT  Thoughts on the menacing DTM BMW M3!

 You can have any color on the M3 DTM as long it is in black

 I can't believe you're complaining about this ;) RT  I think some people just like to complain.

 RT  Best road sign ever:  
  No problem, enjoy reading the site
  Thanks for the RT :) 
  Yeah, I know.. thats the $100,000 question.. What is everyone going to do 
  Oh, you just reminded me Picture of the three original members of  live 
 Thanks for the congrats:         
  Well, Land Rover is testing hybrids and I expect diesels will play a big role

 Thanks to everyone who participated tonight, I was worried but you guys came though. 
 Remember, like us on facebook at   RT if you already have.. We want more people joining us
 Well, I think this wraps up  Live for tonight. Thanks to everyone who put up with me and the problems I had earlier.
  really? Luxury manufacturers are behind?  
   Yeah, the successor to the Veyron - 2,000 HP ;)
  Ask and ye shall receive -  
 How will truck & luxury automakers manage to meet government CAFE regulations while delivering the power their customers demand? 
  So you wouldn't use an extension cord to charge it? ;) 
  Well, the Urea injection and the particulate filters add alot of cost 
 Would you consider the purchase of an electric car? 
  I think I need to talk to you about domestic made fuels.. since you know a lot.. ;-) 
 I love diesel, but with stringent emission standards the US has and the weight of equipment needed. I can't see it becoming bigger 
  I'm asking it again.. 
 Hydrogen, Ethanol, Diesel, Propane -  Will they play a role for the future? 
 Yes, I want the experience of driving a semi truck in my car ;) RT  Dont forget 12 speed gearboxes.... 
  you just brought up my next question: Are alternative fuels still a option? Why or why not? 
 Like  said earlier RT   the search for MPG while making 450HP lead BMW to tri-turbos! 
 What technology do you see automakers using to meet consumer demand and CAFE regulations in the future? 
  Cliff notes version: Autoblog took a Chevy Cruze Eco, Honda Civic Hybrid, and VW Jetta.. Cruze Eco was deemed favorite 
  You do realize I have a link  -   
 Were you surprised by Autoblog's findings? Do you disagree? What car would you have deemed king of the pump? 
  Look at Europe, Alfa is niche brand there as well.. Expecting the same here 
  We'll get to that shortly 
 Last week,  recently compared 3 fuel sippers that were propelled in 3 distinct ways.   
  Yeah, thats what I'm wondering here.. 
  Thanks for joining us 
 As consumers and lawmakers demand cars be more efficient the search for MPG will take many different routes 
 When its on fire sure RT   better than a 458?  Nothing looks better...nothing 
 RT  And finally to our last topic - Attack of the Fuel Sippers 
 Hmm, some very interesting thoughts on Alfa.. Glad I'm not the only one worrying about it.. 
  Depends which Ferrari we are talking about 
  I know... 
  I know.. It makes me sad to see that.. I don't think anyone at Fiat knows what Alfa Romeo is supposed to be 
  No one knows except at Fiat.. I bet we will find out in due time 
  For a time, The BTCC and WTCC did have Alfa's racing 
  That's the question, I would focus them at BMW/Audi/Mercedes 
 So that will add what, 5 sales? RT   make a ute?  
 Anyone...   
 So,  participants.. What does Alfa need to do to succeed in the US?
  That's a good question, I've heard they would sell them at Chrysler dealers 
 Is this the right lineup for the US? Will it succeed? 
 4C is their launch car in late 2012.. Followed by the Giuletta, Guila, and a SUV.. 
  I actually have seen a Giulietta running around and I agree with that statement 
 Looking at Alfa's US lineup and missing dates left and right, Do they have a chance? 
  I think you mean Guila, since that's the 159's replacement 
  No, but do know about the problems.. I love that car. 
 Now, Alfa has announced the dates* for their return, starting with the 4C -  
  Hey, I love that pile of junk 
 Since 2003, Alfa Romeo has promised us they would be making a return.. only to miss those dates 
 The last Alfa Romeo sold in the US was the 164 Sedan in 1995 
 Onwards to our next Topic - The mysterious case of Alfa Romeo 
  oooh, exciting 
   I thought Senna was ok.. I think I needed to know a bit more of F1 History to get some of the story 
  You mean the one that would be damaged in one scene and some how magically repair itself in another 
 Where else can a car influence be seen in our culture? And where do we see our culture influence cars? 
  I think we're going to be talking about that in few weeks :) 
   I think I have seen pics of 58 Plymouth, very nice car 
 Hawaii Five-0, I wanr a 74 Mercury Marquis so bad 
 Cars often play an important role in Television as well (say what?) What Television shows have had strong car influences? 
 Wheres the ban button? ;) RT  Friday. Kicking in the front seat, sitting in the back seat, which seat can I take? 
  I was wondering who be the first to mention that ;) 
  You're worrying me again 
 Is there a music video you remember for the cars featured in it? 
 Music has been written about cars since the beginning of the auto industry. What are some notable songs featuring cars? 
  Everything.. Nah, just kidding. We're on the topic of Cars and Culture.. 
  Yes it was Roger Moore, Esprit would make another appearence in For Your Eyes Only 
  you would think he would get points for that   
 What do you think about product placement in movies when it comes to cars? Is there a point where the movie becomes an ad? 
 Well it was nice knowing you ;) RT   You rooted the frog car?? U and I are done!! ;)  
 First car comes to mind, Christine.. Plymouth 
 What cars were characters in a movie in their own right? 
  Really, I root for the Peugeot 605 thats chasing it ;) 
  French Connection was a pontiac? 
 Movies often are remembered more for their chase scenes than the actual movie. What chase scene cars do you remember in movies? 
  I thnk you mean cough.. Where's Charlie's twitter? ;) 
 Cars play an important role in our culture whether we realize it or not. 
 Alright, moving along to the next Topic: Cars and Culture 
 Ok, So The Car Show has some good and some bad points (John Sally).. Most everyone like it 
  We're finishing up on Speed's The Car Show 
  Well, Nick if it was a Challenger that had the Dodge logo that went up and down.. I know you'll be all over it 
 Ok, last question: The Car Show or Top Gear USA? 
  Yeah Nick, that's a feature on Rolls 
   Isn't that next weeks show? 
  Neil, I loved.. He did a good job with the Rolls test and wished he poured some Grey Purpon on Corolla 
  You know, I'm not too keen on Matt Farah as a host.. I need to watch more before I decide 
 Okay, now that I'm back.. What did you think about the segments? Loved the Rolls test and GT3.. Other parts concerned me 
 Is that a Steven Segaull film? RT  on general car note, bad guys drive a GN in the movie "Out For Justice" 
  Dude, thanks for joining us till your phone died 
  Wait, really? Are you ok? 
 Which is so awsome to happen during  just to let everyone know
 Sorry everyone, my internet konked out on me 
 I'm going to surprise everyone, I loved John Sally.. Now Adam Corolla, I wanted to throat punch

  I think they are people at Cadillac who believe in that.. (But its a small minority) 
   Yeah, Cadillac is going in 15 different directions at once.. Some focus could help that 
 Yes, I know its a repairable.. But I would buy and repair it..   
 Yes.. For now RT   is having success this year with some great cars. Is it eating Caddy's Lunch? 
  If I had to, Volt.. Otherwise, I'm looking at other vehicles 
  Oh, I know that very well.. I don't kid when I say  in MI 85% and possibly higher are vehicles from the Big 3 
  But look, I know there a few dealers outside of Michigan that have Volts on their lots.. I'm just a special case 
   I don't wear the rose colored glasses (I'm a harsh critic of GM when I need to be) 
  Well, where I'm at, I see dealers that only have 1 volt.. and thats the demo unit 
  I believe so, dealers were only getting a few at a time 
  Well, you did improve the HP by a tenfold ;)
  Yes, More Volts going into dealerships means more sales 
    
 uhh..  RT    I'd pet the Fiat lol  
 If it comes out 1st RT  Could the 4.5TD "MiniMax" be a true game changer in the half ton market?  
 I think the word you're looking for is antique RT    this is what I hear, int feels dated

  Let me ask the obvious question? WHY?  
  I envy you so much right now
   I would read in a bar.. That way no one bothers me at all..
 Wow, the name change works RT  The Chrysler 200 is selling at over twice the rate of the Sebring. 
 cue  RT  1,000 year-old Ford Ranger had 65% of the sales volume of new Explorer in July.
