 Q2: I don't have anyone who doesn't support a healthy lifestyle in my life. I'm really the only one who has the issues. lol

 Hello, I'm G96, or Going For 96. Today I'm one step closer and it was a good day. 
 "I'm not gonna gain my weight back!" It's like Sloth returned from the dead 
 oh my. it is  tonight?!!
 I came back to blogging, so there's that!  
 q4 f/u: tracking really helped me visualize portions into a numbers game. 
 q4: The numbers game, for me, was an early part of the weight loss battle.Counting at this point seems useless.I should know why I'm gaining
 Q3: counting was critical in the first years of weight loss. Not a huge component now. 
 Read  latest.  It's a snapshot into the early days of the weight loss journey. Great article.
 Resolutions? Smesolutions.

 Bloggin' again. 
  I have returned!  
 HAPPY NEW YEAR!
 I haven't visited the twitterverse or my blog friends in a while. I hope everyone is doing well & LOSING! 
  The ultimate goal for me to is to get where you're talking about.
 There's something gratifying about stepping on the scale for the first time in 3 weeks and the result NOT being the worst thing ever. WOOHOO
 I had a hugely successful September, followed by a stupid October. November, life renewed.
 Good times tonight,  See you on the flippy flop.
 Q5:Listening to my body is important,pushing it only as far as I can w/o getting hurt,so there isn't a set number of days for rest. 
 Q4:This month was supposed to be blogging about my food&umm,Ive blogged little.Its a long journey& this part of the battle sucks. 
 Q3.2:Nope.Small following due to sporadic posting,& boring posts that are important just 2 me & my journey  
 Q3.1:There are just a handful I comment on with any regularity.There are many I may drive-by comment once a month/2 months 
 Q3Cont.: Im not a huge commenter(kinda explains my  of readers),but there are those I read because their story is very similar 
 Q3: Personal interest,which can be the subject of the blog,or the person blogging.Sometimes someone inspires me to respond 
 Q2.1:Id delete them if I feel like it. I dont answer to anyone for any reason. My blog = my rules 
 Q2 Cont.:I dont care about negative stuff. As a blogger,my belief is if ya cant stand the heat,get ya ass out da kitchen lol 
 Q2: I dont get negative comments. Lol. I have few,but very loyal and friendly, readers.

 Q4: Fat..but less fat than today. 
 Q3.1 I don't try motivating anyone but myself. Selfish, but I ain't gonna lie to ya. 
 Q3: Motivation? How awesome I feel and look, and I'm not even a third of the way of where I want to be. 
 Q2.1 This one doesn't really apply. I'm a pretty happy guy generally. I like to laugh every day. no need to actively do something. 
 Q2: Happiness is what you make it.Less about numbers and goals, more about mental health and stability. 
 Q1.2 Honestly? It goes in waves. I kick so much ass,and then sometimes slip. It's just getting back on the horse. 
 Q1: This journey has been the most challenging obstacle in my life. by far. Keep on plugging. It's the only choice. 
 Hello fat losers! Great to be here! Woohoo! 
 I tried to stay into  but baseball postseason really just didn't allow it. Maybe next season. lol.
 Decided responding to Marie Claire's 'Big Six' with -My- Big Six was a better way to respond. 
 I appreciate the comments,very cool that you take time to read my blog!RT   Great post! I really enjoy your writing
 Q5: honestly?I think about the 30 lbs Ive lost,& how much better the sex is & imagine it w/ even more weight loss. GREAT motivation 
 Q4.2 If someone found me inspiring,awesome,but i'd rather engage in a give & take on what works for me and them & compare notes 
 Q4.2: No.I'm not a cheerleader type,I  never really considered my journey from the view of others 
 Q4: My grandmother.Blog is named in honor of her 96 years.Healthy & rational w/ food/weight. 
 Got here late. Q3.2: Muscle soreness from workouts impact food choices greatly. Seriously! 
 I've heard Eminem's "I'm Not Afraid" on my last 5 bike rides, via 2 car stereos,2 house radios,& even bike rider w/ radio!
  Welcome to the Twitterverse, my friend. *I* will be getting up early to get in the miles!
 Interesting read! RT  New Article: If Blogging Cliques Are Real, Do They Hurt The Community? 
 I entered Twothirtyland for the first time in maybe 6 years..and decided to blog about it. 
 TweetDeck is a must to accomplish it! RT  How do u manage multiple twitter accounts?   
 Isn't that cute, they're bringing back all of the losers! 
 Not sure if I'll make  tonight, but I hope so.
 5.45 miles biked in wetness of the city  Not too shabby. Thank God it's a bit warm tonight!
 6am is a GREAT time for a bike ride!
 HE'S CUT! HE'S CUT! THE FACEBOOK IS CUT!
 OMG  crashed!No doubt productivity will rise at workplaces worldwide!!
 There are 100 days left in the year. Have you achieved any New Years resolutions?You still have time!

 Brag: I don't mind bragging that I've also lost 27.5 pounds since June 16. Nearly a stud, but a ways to go still. lol 
 Brag:This is the longest sustained weight loss journey I've had in my entire life. 3 months down, decades to go. 
 Q4F/U: I haven't reached the 'obsession' level of weight loss.I obsessed about eating,so I'm trying not to obsess ANYTHING. lol 
 Q4:Push yourself hard,but not too hard.Hurting yourself will set you back even further 
 Q3F/U:  is a true inspiration.He has a journey like no other, and he's tackling it like a true champion. 
 Q3: "How much have you lost? I can see it." -said before I mentioned weight loss,is great because I can't 'see' it yet. 
 WHY IS EVERYBODY DYING!!!! 
 Q2F/U: I'm losing weight! Losing Weight = that much closer to actually running! 
 Q2: Make my legs and knees stronger so I can run now rather than waiting til I lose more weight. 
 I'm PUMPED the 421 pounder one.That dude has nearly 200 pounds on both ladies.How was that even fair? Good for him. 
 Q1F/U2: Never really had 'fitness' role models growing up. huh. maybe that explains some things. lol. 
 I think I'm doing quite well balancing  and 
 Q1 F/U:In Early June I attended a wedding & weighed the most I ever have.9 days later my journey to today & beyond officially began 
 "My mom is miserable" - Nice. I bet your mom's about to dopeslap you. lol 
 Q1: I was kind of fit in a chubby-kid-who-is-active.I've always had athletic abilities,despite increasing my weight every year 
 The two biggest folks won that contest, that's fun.I wonder if she would've made it w/ 500 stair steps. 
 I'm a chubby dude who is Going For 96,the age of my grandmother when she passed. Can't get there being a fat ass, so here I am. 
 Why are some people running, and others stair stepping?  Why not all the same? 
  the new weight loss motivator. 
 Just as an aside, constantly has a look on her face like someone nearby farted 
 I dont like this show because it pits people against each other.NOTHING is better than supporting one another. 
 "I know if I don't make Biggest Loser, I will not do it on my own" - What a terrible attitude towards weight loss. 
 Weight of '1 mile run' contestants, 231/391/263. Winners of contest weight, 231/263..um..Why am I not surprised? 
 I would LOVE to weight 231! 
 Has Biggest Loser always been this...hand picked? Seems like it is. 
 "I need the Biggest Loser" Oy Vey. No, you need self confidence. 
 Has Biggest Loser ever had a fitness challenge to choose who makes it to the show? 
 I'm so happy there are no videos of me chowing down on a gigantic sandwich 
 So the heaviest guy lost, and will not be on  Doesn't it make more sense for him to be on it?It's not  called 
  EST, so, 10 C?
   starts at 9!
 I'm going to give  a chance,but already, I dont understand weeping at weight numbers.  about weight.
  :) RT some DILLHOLE had the nerve to say i have a FAT ASS.    
 ooh..  = Biggest Loser?
 What is 
 I reached my goal of biking 500 miles!!! A goal I set on June 16th!
  Indeed you can.  is better than 
 $100 for  I do stupid human tricks instead to get a free ticket?If I rode my bike there,it may take 2.5 days!Thatd be fun!
 "I'm mulling things over in my head about food."  "I'm beating myself up over what I ate recently."
 "I had a tough week"  "I ate like a cow."

 Need a Q5 RT 
  Might be the greatest response of the night. Woohoo! 
 Q4F/U2: A Year from now?I hope I'm near 210 pounds.200 would be great.199 would be incredible.think small,leads to big.Works for me 
 Q4F/U:Not gonna lie,a steady paycheck. Pronto,Tonto. 
 Q4F/U:Ive stopped setting weight loss goal end dates,but Id like to reach 230 lbs by year end.750 Miles Biked would be great too 
 Q4:This month I will reach 500 Miles biked,a goal I set on June 16th.May blow it away with my  Challenge in Sept 
 Q3F/U:Itd probably be worse if I offered up bloggers I think have sold out for money, huh? No,no,I dont need any more enemies.lol 
 Q3F/U:I guess 'sell out' can be annoying if they flood their blog with ads.Even still,there are so many blogs,Its easy to 'move on'.
 Q3F/U:I don't care if a blogger 'sells out'.Especially if they lost a ton of weight.Its easy to sniff out a bogus blog entry, IMO 
 Q3:dont mind giveaways,but dont think folks realize the Co.'s offering them dont care abt anything but gettin the link in the entry 
 Q2 F/U:I use WordPress, really like the ease of using it.Never considered hosting service,seems like it might change why/how I blog.
 Q2: I dont have much money,so splurging is spending 3-4 hours biking instead of 2.Time is priceless,so dedicating that is splurging 
 Q1F/U: Free range food when I can. 
 Q1: Unemployment forces you to stop buying the junk food that contributes to weight issues...at least it has for me. 
 Three Words? LOSE THAT FAT 
 I'm Going For 96, which was the age of my grandmother. Love me some 
 Blogged about my issue with Weight Watcher Twinkies,turned into a blog about my own issues! 
  You can rent bikes by the Seaport for around $15-$50/HR  & Yelp has a big long rental list  
 Wait..the bike clothing covered in advertising isn't FREE? You have to actually BUY the ad-covered clothing?!Looks like mesh short forever!
  I don't think the unfollows would be because of your beliefs...unless your tweets become more about atheism than weight loss

 Late night peanut butter sandwiches have been replaced by carrots.
 "Accountability Coach"? That's a real thing? Good God Almighty, that is 6 styles of stupid.
 played around with mapmyride to find a lengthy route to a destination. Bumped things up to 10 miles instead of 5. And away we go!
 I talked about, failing, death, swimming and kicking some ass. 
 My 30th Checkin' In, I blogged about revisiting an old ride. 9.31 miles. Woo.

  I've notice a lot of anti-dairy stuff.Seems nonsensical to cut out a specific food group,unless the group is junk food.lol
  No doubt. I've never followed strict diets,just trying to make sensible eating choices.
  Interesting.Hard to know if true.Celebs can afford chefs & personal trainers,so him losing lots of weight seems plausible.
 Great job getting refocused!RT  blog post:New Paddles & Snorkel, Focus on the Process,&Setbacks

 I didn't go biking today, but after nearly 40 miles in 2 days,I think that's ok. I blogged instead. 
  thanks for answering!I may have more, if that's okay!
  w/ dieters we hear about people's 'worst snack'.Since your transformation,whats your 'best snack' that you eat constantly?
 I biked 25 miles today, because it was so damn beautiful out..and I blogged about it 
 After 25 miles of riding, I enjoyed a great grilled chicken dinner with string beans!
 What are people's feelings towards providing a link and reviewing a product for a gift certificate in return?Does 1 link in 1 entry matter?

 5 pounds lost in about a week? Seems like a little too much, maybe not for someone in their 260sish?
 Late Night Weigh In..turns into a blogging entry that turns into an inner monologue about Water Weight. Woo! 
 Wasn't expecting a drop today, especially when I weighed in. It was a 'eh,lets see where we're at' weigh in. Very happy to see it though!
 I biked 21 miles in the heat and blogged about it! 
 88 degrees, city biking, 2 hours, 40 miles, 21 miles. Not too shabby!
 It's hot outside. Let's go for a bike ride. How does 20 miles sound? Let's do it.
 Anyone knows that months of good habits can be killed by a slipup and reverse back to years of bad habits.  doesn't address reality
 I don't understand the enjoyment of  &  chance do they have of reversing YEARS of bad habits in 5 days?1/1000?
 "He thinks I'm a character on TV" -  Ha. She IS a character on TV.
 It's like the professionals are good cops &  is the bad cop. She's the one who says 'ha! you're an idiot, fatty!'
  that's part of the reason I went anonymous. It allows some more freedom.
 I was given the 'Versatile Blogger Award' by Responsibility 199,& I handed the award out to 15 great guy bloggers!

 Thanks for the    you ladies are awesome!
  I'd give it a whirl!
  that's the trouble! The burger puts me too close to the slippery slope to chubby!
  Imagine a place like that...with the same cheap prices as the burger joint! It'd be heaven.

 Q3F/U2:I used to try to eke out comments from my posts,but stopped when it impacted my ability to write freely. 
 Q3f/u:Needing a following is potential for disaster,diet-wise.What if no one reads? 
 Q3 F/U: Personally,I dont care if I have followers,but I enjoy discussing things!Feedback is hardly ever a bad thing. 
 13.5 miles tonight on the bike! Tuna for dinner! Great day!
 To save myself from ruin, at BBQs,I go after the salad/fruit/veggies. It's like free food,calorie-wise!Watching the dressings & dips!
  thanks for the 
 quick update, I'm back in the saddle again. 
 Biked over 12 miles today. It was awesome!
  Yep, in this case, my 'loser' lists are positive lists, not negative =)
 The online weight loss community is overwhelmingly female,why are the best support groups women-only?Weight loss is a venture for both sexes
 I'm definitely biking today. WOO!

 It's damn hot...but I might bust out the bike tonight, I blogged about it and the Tour De France. 
 All of the bloggers who have blogged over the weekend;Thank You. It's much needed for getting back into the right mindset.
 After smoke from the fireworks cleared,I checked in with thoughts on weight loss, Jonah Hill and biking 
 Not a bad long weekend..but without working out, not sure how the scale will look.
 If someone was told biking would ADD calories,imagine how quick they'd drop that habit.Easy to pack fat.Not easy to unpack fat.Must Ride On!
 Biked to get a lobster roll w/ the gf for her birthday.Unbelievable coincidence.Hit 100.74 miles total over the last 15 days!!!
 9.5 pounds down from my highest on 6/16. WOOHOO!

 After lamenting over every day weigh-ins not changing much, today a nice happy surprise drop. 9 lbs down from starting weight.
 Why are the twitter  gone?
 I wonder whether there are people who go biking, rain or shine? Must be a different experience altogether.
 I've biked over 40 miles since Saturday! Woohoo! 
 Uh..Thanks  now rocking out to Britney Spears' 'Stronger'. I'm a dude..we can't listen to this without headphones. hahaha
 That was a lot of fun.Found a lot of great folks here.I'll definitely check you guys out in the next 
 Q3: Till I Collapse by Eminem has really gotten a heavy amount of play recently. 
 I used to blog publicly, then privately, and decided my best success at weight loss was anonymous. 
 Blogging about friends & work seems like a natural part of weight loss blogging,since both can impact your health greatly.
  Same here.Helps me not worry about anything at all.One of my goals is to get over that hump though. 
  Anyone else anonymous weight loss bloggers? LOL seems like i'm the only anonymous weight loss guy!
 This is fascinating.Do any of you use gum to help prevent additional eating? 
 What is this  hashtagging business. Live action twittery blogging?I biked over 12 miles today, so that's good. right?
 2 trips, 1 bike. I wrote about biking in the evening rather than early in the day 
 If I drove those biked miles,it would've cost me $3.57 in gas. Saved me more than $12 if I had used public transportation!
 Over the last 2 wks I've biked/walked near 65 miles,lowering my carbon output by 69 lbs(doesnt count for the old butt trumpet emissions tho)
 Did a 3+ mile bike ride this morning..added nearly 10 miles this evening.For whatever reasons,I ride much better in the evening.
 Did a short 3 mile trip this morning on the bike..thinking of doing another longer one this evening.
  made me think,for the 2nd time this week,about lost bloggers. So I wrote about it. Where Are They Now? 
 I biked 19 miles a few days ago,and walk 2 miles yesterday..how is it my body hurts more from WALKING?
  is the kind of guy I'd like to become!Used cycling to change his life.Remarkably.Check out his blog- 
 I know its been said,but wow, twitter & facebook have changed blogging altogether.In a good way.
 Just discovered  great weight loss blogger,HIGHLY recommend checking her out.blog link: 
 Checkin' In, with a playlist from my 2.2 mile walk. 
 2.2 mile walk in 30 minutes. Not too shabby.
 Just when I think maybe I won't do anything today, I walked around for a while. Woohoo!
 So the question of the day; wait for the impending thunderboomers,or try to bike before it hits? May have to wait this out.
  Do it for yourself, and it becomes a lot easier. Even simply writing your general feeling about the day, is good. It's for you.
 It's so hot I can't even hang out on my tweetdeck! 
 Not feeling sore after biking 19 miles yesterday! Yay!
 If I could lose a pound for every follower I have, I'd be in a great place.
 Accidently linked my own article when i meant to link  It's a great read on how others view your weight loss

 Just finished a 19 mile bike trip.

 Funny how blogging can inspire yourself.

 I cant properly express my dislike of 'Losing It With Jillian',but honestly it simplifies a larger(no pun intended) problem with obesity.
 Hello, Weight Loss World. I'm back in the land of chubby bloggers. Read my first entry 
 Just started on the twitter, looking for my weight loss friends!
 Ran my first Muddy Buddy. 6 off roading miles of biking & running & obstacle courses. Have a LOT of work to do. 
 Q3 If time is an issue, I'll try planning ahead by working double hard before/after the time restraint. IE Longer bike rides. 
 Q2: I don't have anyone who doesn't support a healthy lifestyle in my life. I'm really the only one who has the issues. lol 
 Q1 (cont.) I should say stick to dietary changes..not just a straight 'diet'. 
 Hello  Long time no see! I missed Q1, I'm guessing it's about roadblocks? Mine is sticking to a diet
 Biked 14.63 miles today..460 miles total this year! Woohooo! 
 Biked almost 28 miles today around Brooklyn, NY. Nearly 170 on the month, and 420 on the year. Feeling good!
 Man, it is depressing having to delete blogs from your blog list because they've been MIA for 6 months.  
 I come out from behind the curtain of the anonymous. "Hello, My Name Is Michael." 
 I'm starting the  Challenge today. Here we go!
 I'm about 177 miles away from 1000 since June of last year. Not too shabby.
 Biked over 14 miles today! Hit 150 miles for the year! Woohoo!
 I have biked 80+ miles since starting 
 Yup,    oh cool, is there a website or group or anything?
  I'm gonna twitterstalk all y'all.  y'all what what! lol
  My brag started early. I'm biking 30 days in a row, starting Friday.Last  I biked 367 miles!

  Anyone doing  Starts on Friday!!
  Q4 I don't hate any exercise equipment..there are just a bunch I've never bothered to try out. lol
  Q3 I lost 25 pounds riding a bike I bought eight years ago. That's pretty cost effective, if I do say so!
   Never been tempted to do fad diets. Except maybe the Dont Eat Like A Fat Ass Diet. =)
  Not gonna lie, the shakeweight looks ridiculously awesome 
  not really a 'brag',but I agreed to a 'no fried food' challenge from my sister. No fried food til August 23rd!
  Q4: Sounds cliche, but eat to live, not live to eat.
  Q3: Making meals for myself.
  Q2:  Not until college did my mom mention my weight. By then I had ballooned pretty big. Been working on it for 6-7 years now.
 My parents eat healthy, but my siblings & I don't. Not really sure how that happened  Q1
 Nothing to brag about this week, but hopefully next week.  Thanks 
 I live in NYC,every bodega is a 'farmers market'. lol. Bananas, 3 for a buck! yay! 
 Q2.1: I appreciate the ease of breathing, now that I've lost weight. I want more weight loss = better sleep! 
 q2:It's Mental Mental Mental.Ever 'temptation' starts in the noggin.I'm still trying to conquer them.

 I had steak & potatoes. Whooops.  but it was sooo daaaang gooooood
 Hello, I'm G96, or Going For 96. Today I'm one step closer and it was a good day. 
 "I'm not gonna gain my weight back!" It's like Sloth returned from the dead 
 oh my. it is  tonight?!!
 I came back to blogging, so there's that!  
 q4 f/u: tracking really helped me visualize portions into a numbers game. 
 q4: The numbers game, for me, was an early part of the weight loss battle.Counting at this point seems useless.I should know why I'm gaining
 Q3: counting was critical in the first years of weight loss. Not a huge component now. 
 Read  latest.  It's a snapshot into the early days of the weight loss journey. Great article.
 Resolutions? Smesolutions. 
  still going?
 Bloggin' again. 
  I have returned!  
 HAPPY NEW YEAR!
 I haven't visited the twitterverse or my blog friends in a while. I hope everyone is doing well & LOSING! 
  The ultimate goal for me to is to get where you're talking about.
 There's something gratifying about stepping on the scale for the first time in 3 weeks and the result NOT being the worst thing ever. WOOHOO
 I had a hugely successful September, followed by a stupid October. November, life renewed.
 Good times tonight,  See you on the flippy flop.
 Q5:Listening to my body is important,pushing it only as far as I can w/o getting hurt,so there isn't a set number of days for rest. 
 Q4:This month was supposed to be blogging about my food&umm,Ive blogged little.Its a long journey& this part of the battle sucks. 
 Q3.2:Nope.Small following due to sporadic posting,& boring posts that are important just 2 me & my journey  
 Q3.1:There are just a handful I comment on with any regularity.There are many I may drive-by comment once a month/2 months 
 Q3Cont.: Im not a huge commenter(kinda explains my  of readers),but there are those I read because their story is very similar 
 Q3: Personal interest,which can be the subject of the blog,or the person blogging.Sometimes someone inspires me to respond 
 Q2.1:Id delete them if I feel like it. I dont answer to anyone for any reason. My blog = my rules 
 Q2 Cont.:I dont care about negative stuff. As a blogger,my belief is if ya cant stand the heat,get ya ass out da kitchen lol 
 Q2: I dont get negative comments. Lol. I have few,but very loyal and friendly, readers. 
 Q1.2: Nobody makes better coffee than I do! lol Good evening,  friends
 Love  this weeks inspiration-focused theme didnt suit me well.great to read others thoughts on the Qs though.look fw to next wk

 Q4: Fat..but less fat than today. 
 Q3.1 I don't try motivating anyone but myself. Selfish, but I ain't gonna lie to ya. 
 Q3: Motivation? How awesome I feel and look, and I'm not even a third of the way of where I want to be. 
 Q2.1 This one doesn't really apply. I'm a pretty happy guy generally. I like to laugh every day. no need to actively do something. 
 Q2: Happiness is what you make it.Less about numbers and goals, more about mental health and stability. 
 Q1.2 Honestly? It goes in waves. I kick so much ass,and then sometimes slip. It's just getting back on the horse. 
 Q1: This journey has been the most challenging obstacle in my life. by far. Keep on plugging. It's the only choice. 
 Hello fat losers! Great to be here! Woohoo! 
 I tried to stay into  but baseball postseason really just didn't allow it. Maybe next season. lol.
 Decided responding to Marie Claire's 'Big Six' with -My- Big Six was a better way to respond. 
 I appreciate the comments,very cool that you take time to read my blog!RT   Great post! I really enjoy your writing
 Q5: honestly?I think about the 30 lbs Ive lost,& how much better the sex is & imagine it w/ even more weight loss. GREAT motivation 
 Q4.2 If someone found me inspiring,awesome,but i'd rather engage in a give & take on what works for me and them & compare notes 
 Q4.2: No.I'm not a cheerleader type,I  never really considered my journey from the view of others 
 Q4: My grandmother.Blog is named in honor of her 96 years.Healthy & rational w/ food/weight. 
 Got here late. Q3.2: Muscle soreness from workouts impact food choices greatly. Seriously! 
 I've heard Eminem's "I'm Not Afraid" on my last 5 bike rides, via 2 car stereos,2 house radios,& even bike rider w/ radio!
  Welcome to the Twitterverse, my friend. *I* will be getting up early to get in the miles!
 Interesting read! RT  New Article: If Blogging Cliques Are Real, Do They Hurt The Community? 
 I entered Twothirtyland for the first time in maybe 6 years..and decided to blog about it. 
 TweetDeck is a must to accomplish it! RT  How do u manage multiple twitter accounts?   
 Isn't that cute, they're bringing back all of the losers! 
 Not sure if I'll make  tonight, but I hope so.
 5.45 miles biked in wetness of the city  Not too shabby. Thank God it's a bit warm tonight!

 Brag: I don't mind bragging that I've also lost 27.5 pounds since June 16. Nearly a stud, but a ways to go still. lol 
 Brag:This is the longest sustained weight loss journey I've had in my entire life. 3 months down, decades to go. 
 Q4F/U: I haven't reached the 'obsession' level of weight loss.I obsessed about eating,so I'm trying not to obsess ANYTHING. lol 
 Q4:Push yourself hard,but not too hard.Hurting yourself will set you back even further 
 Q3F/U:  is a true inspiration.He has a journey like no other, and he's tackling it like a true champion. 
 Q3: "How much have you lost? I can see it." -said before I mentioned weight loss,is great because I can't 'see' it yet. 
 WHY IS EVERYBODY DYING!!!! 
 Q2F/U: I'm losing weight! Losing Weight = that much closer to actually running! 
 Q2: Make my legs and knees stronger so I can run now rather than waiting til I lose more weight. 
 I'm PUMPED the 421 pounder one.That dude has nearly 200 pounds on both ladies.How was that even fair? Good for him. 
 Q1F/U2: Never really had 'fitness' role models growing up. huh. maybe that explains some things. lol. 
 I think I'm doing quite well balancing  and 
 Q1 F/U:In Early June I attended a wedding & weighed the most I ever have.9 days later my journey to today & beyond officially began 
 "My mom is miserable" - Nice. I bet your mom's about to dopeslap you. lol 
 Q1: I was kind of fit in a chubby-kid-who-is-active.I've always had athletic abilities,despite increasing my weight every year 
 The two biggest folks won that contest, that's fun.I wonder if she would've made it w/ 500 stair steps. 
 I'm a chubby dude who is Going For 96,the age of my grandmother when she passed. Can't get there being a fat ass, so here I am. 
 Why are some people running, and others stair stepping?  Why not all the same? 
  the new weight loss motivator. 
 Just as an aside, constantly has a look on her face like someone nearby farted 
 I dont like this show because it pits people against each other.NOTHING is better than supporting one another. 
 "I know if I don't make Biggest Loser, I will not do it on my own" - What a terrible attitude towards weight loss. 
 Weight of '1 mile run' contestants, 231/391/263. Winners of contest weight, 231/263..um..Why am I not surprised? 
 I would LOVE to weight 231! 
 Has Biggest Loser always been this...hand picked? Seems like it is. 
 "I need the Biggest Loser" Oy Vey. No, you need self confidence. 
 Has Biggest Loser ever had a fitness challenge to choose who makes it to the show? 
 I'm so happy there are no videos of me chowing down on a gigantic sandwich 
 So the heaviest guy lost, and will not be on  Doesn't it make more sense for him to be on it?It's not  called 
  EST, so, 10 C?
   starts at 9!
 I'm going to give  a chance,but already, I dont understand weeping at weight numbers.  about weight.
  :) RT some DILLHOLE had the nerve to say i have a FAT ASS.    
 ooh..  = Biggest Loser?
 What is 
 I reached my goal of biking 500 miles!!! A goal I set on June 16th!
  Indeed you can.  is better than 
 $100 for  I do stupid human tricks instead to get a free ticket?If I rode my bike there,it may take 2.5 days!Thatd be fun!
 "I'm mulling things over in my head about food."  "I'm beating myself up over what I ate recently."
 "I had a tough week"  "I ate like a cow."

 Q5:Motivation?Hmm. It doesnt get more motivating that Nick Vujicic's story.  
 Need a Q5 RT 
  Might be the greatest response of the night. Woohoo! 
 Q4F/U2: A Year from now?I hope I'm near 210 pounds.200 would be great.199 would be incredible.think small,leads to big.Works for me 
 Q4F/U:Not gonna lie,a steady paycheck. Pronto,Tonto. 
 Q4F/U:Ive stopped setting weight loss goal end dates,but Id like to reach 230 lbs by year end.750 Miles Biked would be great too 
 Q4:This month I will reach 500 Miles biked,a goal I set on June 16th.May blow it away with my  Challenge in Sept 
 Q3F/U:Itd probably be worse if I offered up bloggers I think have sold out for money, huh? No,no,I dont need any more enemies.lol 
 Q3F/U:I guess 'sell out' can be annoying if they flood their blog with ads.Even still,there are so many blogs,Its easy to 'move on'.
 Q3F/U:I don't care if a blogger 'sells out'.Especially if they lost a ton of weight.Its easy to sniff out a bogus blog entry, IMO 
 Q3:dont mind giveaways,but dont think folks realize the Co.'s offering them dont care abt anything but gettin the link in the entry 
 Q2 F/U:I use WordPress, really like the ease of using it.Never considered hosting service,seems like it might change why/how I blog.
 Q2: I dont have much money,so splurging is spending 3-4 hours biking instead of 2.Time is priceless,so dedicating that is splurging 
 Q1F/U: Free range food when I can. 
 Q1: Unemployment forces you to stop buying the junk food that contributes to weight issues...at least it has for me. 
 Three Words? LOSE THAT FAT 
 I'm Going For 96, which was the age of my grandmother. Love me some 
 Blogged about my issue with Weight Watcher Twinkies,turned into a blog about my own issues! 
  You can rent bikes by the Seaport for around $15-$50/HR  & Yelp has a big long rental list  
 Wait..the bike clothing covered in advertising isn't FREE? You have to actually BUY the ad-covered clothing?!Looks like mesh short forever!
  I don't think the unfollows would be because of your beliefs...unless your tweets become more about atheism than weight loss

 Late night peanut butter sandwiches have been replaced by carrots.
 "Accountability Coach"? That's a real thing? Good God Almighty, that is 6 styles of stupid.
 played around with mapmyride to find a lengthy route to a destination. Bumped things up to 10 miles instead of 5. And away we go!
 I talked about, failing, death, swimming and kicking some ass. 
 My 30th Checkin' In, I blogged about revisiting an old ride. 9.31 miles. Woo.

 I had pork tonight and it was so good, I took a photo of it & blogged. Woo! 
 good stuff! RT    I posted about that the other day....
  I've notice a lot of anti-dairy stuff.Seems nonsensical to cut out a specific food group,unless the group is junk food.lol
  No doubt. I've never followed strict diets,just trying to make sensible eating choices.
  Interesting.Hard to know if true.Celebs can afford chefs & personal trainers,so him losing lots of weight seems plausible.
 Great job getting refocused!RT  blog post:New Paddles & Snorkel, Focus on the Process,&Setbacks

  is great motivation for keeping your week in order
 I didn't go biking today, but after nearly 40 miles in 2 days,I think that's ok. I blogged instead. 
  thanks for answering!I may have more, if that's okay!
  w/ dieters we hear about people's 'worst snack'.Since your transformation,whats your 'best snack' that you eat constantly?
 I biked 25 miles today, because it was so damn beautiful out..and I blogged about it 
 After 25 miles of riding, I enjoyed a great grilled chicken dinner with string beans!
 What are people's feelings towards providing a link and reviewing a product for a gift certificate in return?Does 1 link in 1 entry matter?

 5 pounds lost in about a week? Seems like a little too much, maybe not for someone in their 260sish?
 Late Night Weigh In..turns into a blogging entry that turns into an inner monologue about Water Weight. Woo! 
 Wasn't expecting a drop today, especially when I weighed in. It was a 'eh,lets see where we're at' weigh in. Very happy to see it though!
 I biked 21 miles in the heat and blogged about it! 
 88 degrees, city biking, 2 hours, 40 miles, 21 miles. Not too shabby!
 It's hot outside. Let's go for a bike ride. How does 20 miles sound? Let's do it.
 Anyone knows that months of good habits can be killed by a slipup and reverse back to years of bad habits.  doesn't address reality
 I don't understand the enjoyment of  &  chance do they have of reversing YEARS of bad habits in 5 days?1/1000?
 "He thinks I'm a character on TV" -  Ha. She IS a character on TV.
 It's like the professionals are good cops &  is the bad cop. She's the one who says 'ha! you're an idiot, fatty!'
  that's part of the reason I went anonymous. It allows some more freedom.
 I was given the 'Versatile Blogger Award' by Responsibility 199,& I handed the award out to 15 great guy bloggers!

 Q3f/u:Needing a following is potential for disaster,diet-wise.What if no one reads? 
 Q3 F/U: Personally,I dont care if I have followers,but I enjoy discussing things!Feedback is hardly ever a bad thing. 
 13.5 miles tonight on the bike! Tuna for dinner! Great day!
 To save myself from ruin, at BBQs,I go after the salad/fruit/veggies. It's like free food,calorie-wise!Watching the dressings & dips!
  thanks for the 
 quick update, I'm back in the saddle again. 
 Biked over 12 miles today. It was awesome!
  Yep, in this case, my 'loser' lists are positive lists, not negative =)
 The online weight loss community is overwhelmingly female,why are the best support groups women-only?Weight loss is a venture for both sexes
 I'm definitely biking today. WOO!
 Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man a ...biker, miss out on the ...rest of 'America's Next Top Artist'!
  c'mon barbie let's go party  BEEBOPBOPBADABOPE!BOPBOPBADABOPE!
  Working up a sweat by exercising for 2 hours,then having energy to have sex.Too much info maybe,but you asked.lol 
  climbing 10 sets of stairs and not being winded. 
  sitting on a bus and not worrying about the guy next to me not having enough room. 
 This is when I'd quit. Instead I've decided to bitch about it. language NSFW 
 Bragging:I've maintained some sense of blogging despite up & downs.Gotta keep on moving, and that includes blogging! 
  is a male blogger I've really made a point to read everything they write.Great insight. 
 Greetings, friends. I'm  I blog at GoingFor96.wordpress.com and I love baseball. 
 What's the link for  updates?
 It's damn hot...but I might bust out the bike tonight, I blogged about it and the Tour De France. 
 All of the bloggers who have blogged over the weekend;Thank You. It's much needed for getting back into the right mindset.
 After smoke from the fireworks cleared,I checked in with thoughts on weight loss, Jonah Hill and biking 
 Not a bad long weekend..but without working out, not sure how the scale will look.
 If someone was told biking would ADD calories,imagine how quick they'd drop that habit.Easy to pack fat.Not easy to unpack fat.Must Ride On!
 Biked to get a lobster roll w/ the gf for her birthday.Unbelievable coincidence.Hit 100.74 miles total over the last 15 days!!!
 9.5 pounds down from my highest on 6/16. WOOHOO!
 I've biked 87 miles in the last 2 weeks. I'll break 100 tomorrow.
 I "Biked For Love" and decided to blog about it. Checkin' In  
  outdoors. My gf's birthday is tomorrow,decided to bike to the store to pick up a final piece of her gift.
 I biked 25 miles today. Holy Sh*t!
 After lamenting over every day weigh-ins not changing much, today a nice happy surprise drop. 9 lbs down from starting weight.
 Why are the twitter  gone?
 I wonder whether there are people who go biking, rain or shine? Must be a different experience altogether.
 I've biked over 40 miles since Saturday! Woohoo! 
 Uh..Thanks  now rocking out to Britney Spears' 'Stronger'. I'm a dude..we can't listen to this without headphones. hahaha
 That was a lot of fun.Found a lot of great folks here.I'll definitely check you guys out in the next 
 Q3: Till I Collapse by Eminem has really gotten a heavy amount of play recently. 
 I used to blog publicly, then privately, and decided my best success at weight loss was anonymous. 
 Blogging about friends & work seems like a natural part of weight loss blogging,since both can impact your health greatly.
  Same here.Helps me not worry about anything at all.One of my goals is to get over that hump though. 
  Anyone else anonymous weight loss bloggers? LOL seems like i'm the only anonymous weight loss guy!
 This is fascinating.Do any of you use gum to help prevent additional eating? 
 What is this  hashtagging business. Live action twittery blogging?I biked over 12 miles today, so that's good. right?
 2 trips, 1 bike. I wrote about biking in the evening rather than early in the day 
 If I drove those biked miles,it would've cost me $3.57 in gas. Saved me more than $12 if I had used public transportation!
 Over the last 2 wks I've biked/walked near 65 miles,lowering my carbon output by 69 lbs(doesnt count for the old butt trumpet emissions tho)
 Did a 3+ mile bike ride this morning..added nearly 10 miles this evening.For whatever reasons,I ride much better in the evening.
 Did a short 3 mile trip this morning on the bike..thinking of doing another longer one this evening.
  made me think,for the 2nd time this week,about lost bloggers. So I wrote about it. Where Are They Now? 
 I biked 19 miles a few days ago,and walk 2 miles yesterday..how is it my body hurts more from WALKING?
  is the kind of guy I'd like to become!Used cycling to change his life.Remarkably.Check out his blog- 
 I know its been said,but wow, twitter & facebook have changed blogging altogether.In a good way.
 Just discovered  great weight loss blogger,HIGHLY recommend checking her out.blog link: 
 Checkin' In, with a playlist from my 2.2 mile walk. 
 2.2 mile walk in 30 minutes. Not too shabby.
 Just when I think maybe I won't do anything today, I walked around for a while. Woohoo!
 So the question of the day; wait for the impending thunderboomers,or try to bike before it hits? May have to wait this out.
  Do it for yourself, and it becomes a lot easier. Even simply writing your general feeling about the day, is good. It's for you.
 It's so hot I can't even hang out on my tweetdeck! 
 Not feeling sore after biking 19 miles yesterday! Yay!
 If I could lose a pound for every follower I have, I'd be in a great place.
 Accidently linked my own article when i meant to link  It's a great read on how others view your weight loss

 Just finished a 19 mile bike trip.

 I was told I don't look like a guy who eats tofu. I wrote about wanting to be a guy not defined by what he eats 
 Yesterday,I was told I don't look like a guy who eats tofu.Believe it or not, that comment made me feel good about my renewed journey.
 Weather.com gave me a forecast of "Sprinkles". Um. Weather.com,I did not ask for a name suggestion for a new kitty.I asked for the forecast!

 entree ordered had lots of tofu.GFs grandma said "You don't look like a guy who would order tofu".My response,"Hopefully someday I will!"
 I go back & forth on telling people in my life about my renewed goals.Haven't even told the GF about the extent of it.Just small details.
 Biked 8.44 miles,and wrote about how Headwind Sucks! 
 8.5 miles on the bike, half against a headwind. Not too shabby.

 He's not on twitter(I don't think),but Responsibility 199 is a great weight loss blog worth checking out. 
  not a problem, really!!! =) I thought it was a great opportunity to say 'boobs'. =)
  As a chubby guy, I've been told I have boobs, but I'm indeed actually a guy. ;)
 Funny how a "loss" heading into the weekend is a "gain" in motivation to keep it off! 6.5 down!

 Is it ever too hot to go biking?I say no. Bring extra water and sweat it out!
 Naps ruin sleep.
 While checking in,I've found what my goals are for the next 16 weeks. 3 goals, 36.5 pounds. Time to 'lose' a bike. 
 Funny how blogging can inspire yourself.
 Candy is my crack.

 What, I shouldn't eat all of this candy right now? I wrote about moderation in the candy department. 
 Another wedding celebration complete.Celebrated love,not pigging out at the 'candy' bar. Woo!

 Jamie Moyer is great motivation. At 48 Years Old, he still plays Major League Baseball. It's never too late to reach your potential.
 I went biking after binging on crap. How did it work out? Well, I'm finding where my freedom is. Check it out 
 I think it's time for a bike ride.
 Accepting yourself is the first step to weight loss.If you don't love yourself,it wont matter if you lose 100 pounds.
 What good are 100 calorie Dorito packs if you eat all 10 packs in the box? Quitting Doritos is the key.
 I wrote about my Daily Motivation Pinnacle, something I feel like a lot of people can relate to. Check it out 
  Thanks very much!
 I cant properly express my dislike of 'Losing It With Jillian',but honestly it simplifies a larger(no pun intended) problem with obesity.
 Hello, Weight Loss World. I'm back in the land of chubby bloggers. Read my first entry 
 Just started on the twitter, looking for my weight loss friends!
