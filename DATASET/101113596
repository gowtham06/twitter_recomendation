  nice to see you on Twitter, sir! Missing you.
  and telling the story of why it's essential/fun/important/sexy/interesting... even Jamey + Linda talking about project!
  understood - but did you check out other Kickstarter projects for ideas? It's about selling your project...
  6) Your Kickstarter video isn't about the project; it's an old promo piece for BodyVox... not exciting for prosp. supporters
  5) Generally folks use Kickstarter to "kickstart" a project; it's odd yr campaign goes after your project has finished
  4) Utilizing Kickstarter to fund new work seems to indicate your org doesn't believe in supporting the work itself
  3) It seems Kickstarter is the provenance of upstarts + individual artists; why would a major arts institution need it?
  2) CMNW has a large and loyal base of supporters. Were they not interested in supporting this new work?
  frankly, I find it to be odd. 1) CMNW has already programmed the piece, and it's happening regardless of Kickstarter funding
  hold up: CMNW is doing a Kickstarter fundraising campaign for part of your programming?

  nice to see you on Twitter, sir! Missing you.
  and telling the story of why it's essential/fun/important/sexy/interesting... even Jamey + Linda talking about project!
  understood - but did you check out other Kickstarter projects for ideas? It's about selling your project...
  6) Your Kickstarter video isn't about the project; it's an old promo piece for BodyVox... not exciting for prosp. supporters
  5) Generally folks use Kickstarter to "kickstart" a project; it's odd yr campaign goes after your project has finished
  4) Utilizing Kickstarter to fund new work seems to indicate your org doesn't believe in supporting the work itself
  3) It seems Kickstarter is the provenance of upstarts + individual artists; why would a major arts institution need it?
  2) CMNW has a large and loyal base of supporters. Were they not interested in supporting this new work?
  frankly, I find it to be odd. 1) CMNW has already programmed the piece, and it's happening regardless of Kickstarter funding
