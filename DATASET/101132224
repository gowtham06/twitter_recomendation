    no problem, I just pay attention to certain tweets and try to help whenever I can. Cheers!
  I will be glad to help, tell me more about all the work that you currently need a PA for?
    one of your tweets mentioned you need to hire a VA and I am trying to help out
    what exactly do you need a VA to do for you? I will like to help point you the right way!
    now you can hire Virtual Assistants at a very affordable rate especially foreign ones
  are you looking for a Virtual Assistant?
   what do you need to outsource?
   you can actually hire a VA to help you sort through your email so that you can focus on important stuff
   LOL that is something else and I am sure my team of Virtual Assistants will be glad to help out!
  I read it & really enjoyed your recent blog post about how to "Boost your invite-to-chat ratio" the product-specific invitations
  I'd say outsource and automate everything about it except the engagement. That should be you!
  I totally agree and how can entrepreneurs cultivate and foster this habit in their business?
  hi I am not still heard back from you. Do you still need help finding a VA? Also did you receive my email?
  looking forward to hearing back from you shortly
  feel free to send an email to oenaohwo and I will respond with the free resource
  also I want to send you a free resource that will show you how to find a VA by both the DIY and DFY way. What is your email?
  what you need in that case is a VA service provider who can provide you with backup VAs should one leave. Let's talk
  have you started outsourcing work in your business yet?
