 Wondering if anyone would sign on for a half hr spot to ask golf help. Thoughts anyone???
 7th Tip 01/10/10 - Does the head move? Yes, this side to side movement is part of the weight transfer, but must be done properly.
 6th Tip 01/10/10 - If you want to hit the ball farther you must work out. Increased muscle equals increaed club head speed. Firmer grip too!
 5th Tip 01/10/10 - Come up with a Pre Shot Routine if you want to become more consistent. This helps keep your set up correct.
 4th Tip 01/10/10 - Posture is an important part to your swings plane, and to stop slicing the ball. Learn to bend at the waist, flexed knees
