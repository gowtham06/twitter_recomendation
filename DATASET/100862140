  Yeah, it does. It is harder after 40. Even if I don't reach goal, I believe I can do better.

 Sometimes TV shows go on too long. The writers get tired and I think that has happened with HOUSE.
 Main character on HOUSE has shown no growth and there is nothing about him anymore that is the least bit likable or makes him sympathetic.

  With my history and heredity, I have to take weight and fitness seriously.

 Green tea tastes pretty good iced. It beats Diet Coke and probably much better for you.
  Yeah, it does. It is harder after 40. Even if I don't reach goal, I believe I can do better.
  I haven't decided yet. Last time I gained all back + 10 within 18 months.
  I haven't gained for over a year. That's good, but I'm still 30 lbs overweight and on BP Meds.
 That is 3 cups green tea per day. I suppose I can learn to like the stuff.
 Will 3 cups of green tea really help with weight loss? Easy enough. I will soon find out.
 I'm reading the 17 day diet and asking myself if I can commit. Downside is later gaining all back and more.

 Just put in cucumbers today. Unless something dies an untimely death, I hope that is the end of my fruit/veg asperations for awhile.
 Maybe Twitter is just having problems right now. There is a lot of stuff I can't get Twitter to do for me now.
 I dropped some folks who don't follow me back or have nothing in common, and Twitter still won't let me follow back new followers.
 Twitter still holding me to 2001 tweets.  I hate to drop followers, but the system forces me to be more selective.
 Is Twitter acting crazy today, or is it just me and my computer?
  It is. Along with strawberries, I use plain Greek style yogart sweetened with Splenda and cranberry granola.
 I hope I do well with the tomatoes and peppers. Plants look healthy, but lots of bugs out there, and plants can get eaten in mere days.

 There is a cautionary tale somewhere in the Charlie Sheen story, but for who--a celebirty gone amuck or the society that's enabled him?
 Insane rants and hard living might pay off afterall.  Charlie Sheen has over 2 million Twitter followers.
  Considering that most of my messages are from spammers, I don't think that's such a bad thing.
  At least Britney didn't get all this extra air time. I agree the media are a bunch of enablers.
  People are laughing at Charlie Sheen. His break up is also more public and spectacular than Britney's and Courtney's.
 Celebrity can be deadly when all goes wrong, i.e. Anna Nicole Smith, Michael Jackson, and Elvis. Bad for anyone, but worse for the famous.
 Charlie Sheen stuff is increasingly disturbing. He needs an intervention. It is cruel to let this go on.

  Thyroid disease is not a fun thing. Do you take meds for it?
  With my history and heredity, I have to take weight and fitness seriously.

 Green tea tastes pretty good iced. It beats Diet Coke and probably much better for you.
  Yeah, it does. It is harder after 40. Even if I don't reach goal, I believe I can do better.
  I haven't decided yet. Last time I gained all back + 10 within 18 months.
  I haven't gained for over a year. That's good, but I'm still 30 lbs overweight and on BP Meds.
 That is 3 cups green tea per day. I suppose I can learn to like the stuff.
 Will 3 cups of green tea really help with weight loss? Easy enough. I will soon find out.
 I'm reading the 17 day diet and asking myself if I can commit. Downside is later gaining all back and more.
 Considering doing another diet. Losing weight the "natural" way isn't getting me anywhere.

 I dropped some folks who don't follow me back or have nothing in common, and Twitter still won't let me follow back new followers.
 Twitter still holding me to 2001 tweets.  I hate to drop followers, but the system forces me to be more selective.

  It is. Along with strawberries, I use plain Greek style yogart sweetened with Splenda and cranberry granola.
 I hope I do well with the tomatoes and peppers. Plants look healthy, but lots of bugs out there, and plants can get eaten in mere days.
 Just finished a yogart parfait with my homegrown strawberries. I actually harvested enough to make something with them.
  I'm doing fine.  How are you, Gavin?

 New WIP is my 1st attempt at contemporary American setting.  Hard to do after all these years of dark ages and Regency England.
 Am excited about my new Ipad. Only problem is that I went 2 nights in a row with little sleep because I couldn't leave the thing alone.
 Time to get ready to go to the dentist (Yuck). Especially bad because it's been almost a year since the last visit and this dentist is new.

 Insane rants and hard living might pay off afterall.  Charlie Sheen has over 2 million Twitter followers.
  Considering that most of my messages are from spammers, I don't think that's such a bad thing.
  At least Britney didn't get all this extra air time. I agree the media are a bunch of enablers.
  People are laughing at Charlie Sheen. His break up is also more public and spectacular than Britney's and Courtney's.
 Celebrity can be deadly when all goes wrong, i.e. Anna Nicole Smith, Michael Jackson, and Elvis. Bad for anyone, but worse for the famous.
 Charlie Sheen stuff is increasingly disturbing. He needs an intervention. It is cruel to let this go on.
