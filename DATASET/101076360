  lol not used to staying up this late huh?
  oh ya I havent seen it in a while
  I live close to the woodlands area
  Spring Tx
  I have never been
  very hot lol
  ya i would think so
  hmmmm
  its not about the money its about the getting the point across
  hmmm im good with effects
  lol I have to see this when you do =)
  lol well you can do all of the sexy for both of us
  my picture is one of them
  lol sexyness
  thats lame I would have guessed your last one right off the bat =)
  that was a great idea
  =) sweetnesssss
  as do I the red riding style costume
  your going to have to tell me if you like it when you watch it
  =)
  its only six episodes
  I bought that on bluray season 2 comes out in the fall =)
  omg yes its worth buying the dvd
  no lol
  have you seen the walking dead
  I agree you need to see behind the mask as well
  I love that movie its a great story
  lol omg
  I loved Frontiers
  lol i need to see it then is it really scary?
  no not yet
  as do i, I have to go see all of mine alone
  well ill be one of your horror friends all ways could use more for those =)
  thats really not lame trust me I found most of my horror friends online as well =)
  agreed
  I feel the same way thank god for twitter ;)
  lol wow I was the quite type so I never really caused any problems but I can see your point there hell to deal with
  ya what is it that you want to do?
  ya just getting burned out thats why i'm in college i want to get away from where I am now
  I understand my aunt does not seem to enjoy it as much as she used to
  lol nice I have a aunt who is a high school english teacher
  lol
  Business at least that's what I want my degree in
  I love it but im way to busy with college to get on it as much as id like to I just stick with Netflix for the most part :-)
  I have a Xbox very much worth it they have hulu on it now :-)
  lol Awww so u play PS3?
  you mentioned something about it
  ya it was ok but I feel a bit robbed as well not something ill watch again
  have you seen zombie girl?
  ya...so did u like it?
  I guess not I think that ending left more questions then anything she might have been nutz all along mixed with the house
  ya all in all not a bad movie just not what I was hoping for
  im a little upset too where is the cannibalism
  I love that movie
  ya and she gets the friend instead of the husband classic mess up lol
  I loved that when I was a kid =)
  THE WALKING STICK !!!!!
  not sure but its gotta be a classic ax murder
  omg lame see not to say my mom isnt cool but your really the coolest mom I know that is amazing
  not to mention quite hot but thats just coming from a horror fan ;)
  I need more xing tea lol
  yesss lol follow her very good idea
  not sure ? very puzzled
  im sure she could care less about her im sure she just wants to have that baby and get it over with
  ya it might now even be the baby maybe the husband has a strong metal grip on her and wont let her go uh on the intercom!!!!!
  she has too many sets of blocks lol and now shes trying to get away but the baby wont let her ;)
  hellz ya Wal-Mart FTW with the Zombie apocalypse
  sleepwalking again or maybe the baby controlling her lol
  Gosh some many things they could learn from us at least if something like that happened to use we would know what to do =)
  well I think skinning anything in a house would be odd but now theres a grave hmmmm
  really? thats not good
  never seen it :(
  wow he's like a super jerk now I feel bad for her....BLAME THE CHILD? what a ass lol
  ok the husband has officially gone nutz
  I know I wish she would have would have been so much better
  wow that was nutz i bet this baby is taking control of her and making her do things
  shes about to get it lol
  of course lol so are you a English teacher lol
  ya what a jerk u know hes sleeping around on her
  lol cool moms thats who =)
  he wants the baby more then her lol
  lol night of the living dead on the tv nice touch
  so many bunnies lol I like how hes trying to be sorry but it still seems like he not really giving much of a crap
  lol wow now im very interested in  this painting......I bet he has the baby room locked up were she cant get to it
  ya the painting must have a lot to do with it......its more then likely a pentagram or something lol
  that painting must have a lot to do with this he seems consumed by it
  no none of the people in the horror film have ever seen any movies that may have helped them lol its a sad truth
  that would be big step for a horror film eating babies lol
  the husband is really creepy like stepfather creepy if you know what i mean ;)
  ya he was sad and wanted a child so now hes making deals with the dead to get her knocked up again
  he knows hes trying to get her pulled in too far before she can get away think about it a farmhouse in the middle of nowhere
  ya the same here =)
  ya like sleepwalking lol
  we will go with the love of horror thing lol
  thats when you know you have seen to many horro films when your prepared for any horror situation  lol
  all alone :(
  now comes the picture with her in it lol
  omg lovely group of guys lol oh no wayyyy a skull!!!!!
  the toilet this is new lol
  that sucks now she can't have sex with him anymore :(
  this is the beginning of the end for them bed/sex = not good lol
  Uh false bottom ftw!!!
  they seem to like putting them in horror films and I bet the husband wont see anything and will end up thinking she's crazy
  lol no cops for miles and a intercom with ghost possibilitys im with u there not for me
  I think that's what the amityville house would be like I sure as he'll wouldn't go in
  I like the second house better lol just a odd thought :-)

  lol well you can do all of the sexy for both of us
  my picture is one of them

  as do I the red riding style costume
  your going to have to tell me if you like it when you watch it
  =)
  its only six episodes
  I bought that on bluray season 2 comes out in the fall =)
  omg yes its worth buying the dvd
  no lol
  have you seen the walking dead
  I agree you need to see behind the mask as well
  I love that movie its a great story
  lol omg
  I loved Frontiers
  lol i need to see it then is it really scary?
  no not yet
  as do i, I have to go see all of mine alone
  well ill be one of your horror friends all ways could use more for those =)
  thats really not lame trust me I found most of my horror friends online as well =)
  agreed
  I feel the same way thank god for twitter ;)
  lol wow I was the quite type so I never really caused any problems but I can see your point there hell to deal with
  ya what is it that you want to do?
  ya just getting burned out thats why i'm in college i want to get away from where I am now
  I understand my aunt does not seem to enjoy it as much as she used to
  lol nice I have a aunt who is a high school english teacher
  lol
  Business at least that's what I want my degree in
  I love it but im way to busy with college to get on it as much as id like to I just stick with Netflix for the most part :-)
  I have a Xbox very much worth it they have hulu on it now :-)
  lol Awww so u play PS3?
  you mentioned something about it
  ya it was ok but I feel a bit robbed as well not something ill watch again
  have you seen zombie girl?
  ya...so did u like it?
  I guess not I think that ending left more questions then anything she might have been nutz all along mixed with the house
  ya all in all not a bad movie just not what I was hoping for
  im a little upset too where is the cannibalism
  I love that movie
  ya and she gets the friend instead of the husband classic mess up lol
  I loved that when I was a kid =)
  THE WALKING STICK !!!!!
  not sure but its gotta be a classic ax murder
  omg lame see not to say my mom isnt cool but your really the coolest mom I know that is amazing
  not to mention quite hot but thats just coming from a horror fan ;)
  I need more xing tea lol
  yesss lol follow her very good idea
  not sure ? very puzzled
  im sure she could care less about her im sure she just wants to have that baby and get it over with
  ya it might now even be the baby maybe the husband has a strong metal grip on her and wont let her go uh on the intercom!!!!!
  she has too many sets of blocks lol and now shes trying to get away but the baby wont let her ;)
  hellz ya Wal-Mart FTW with the Zombie apocalypse
  sleepwalking again or maybe the baby controlling her lol
  Gosh some many things they could learn from us at least if something like that happened to use we would know what to do =)
  well I think skinning anything in a house would be odd but now theres a grave hmmmm
  really? thats not good
  never seen it :(
  wow he's like a super jerk now I feel bad for her....BLAME THE CHILD? what a ass lol
  ok the husband has officially gone nutz
  I know I wish she would have would have been so much better
  wow that was nutz i bet this baby is taking control of her and making her do things
  shes about to get it lol
  of course lol so are you a English teacher lol
  ya what a jerk u know hes sleeping around on her
  lol cool moms thats who =)
  he wants the baby more then her lol
  lol night of the living dead on the tv nice touch
  so many bunnies lol I like how hes trying to be sorry but it still seems like he not really giving much of a crap
  lol wow now im very interested in  this painting......I bet he has the baby room locked up were she cant get to it
  ya the painting must have a lot to do with it......its more then likely a pentagram or something lol
  that painting must have a lot to do with this he seems consumed by it
  no none of the people in the horror film have ever seen any movies that may have helped them lol its a sad truth
  that would be big step for a horror film eating babies lol
  the husband is really creepy like stepfather creepy if you know what i mean ;)
  ya he was sad and wanted a child so now hes making deals with the dead to get her knocked up again
  he knows hes trying to get her pulled in too far before she can get away think about it a farmhouse in the middle of nowhere
  ya the same here =)
  ya like sleepwalking lol
  we will go with the love of horror thing lol
  thats when you know you have seen to many horro films when your prepared for any horror situation  lol
  all alone :(
  now comes the picture with her in it lol
  omg lovely group of guys lol oh no wayyyy a skull!!!!!
  the toilet this is new lol
  that sucks now she can't have sex with him anymore :(
  this is the beginning of the end for them bed/sex = not good lol
  Uh false bottom ftw!!!
  they seem to like putting them in horror films and I bet the husband wont see anything and will end up thinking she's crazy
  lol no cops for miles and a intercom with ghost possibilitys im with u there not for me
  I think that's what the amityville house would be like I sure as he'll wouldn't go in
  I like the second house better lol just a odd thought :-)
