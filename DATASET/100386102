 Why does my kid clench her fists and growl at me?
  I could've gone with a bear or mountain lion but I'm not sure they'd stop at only your arm so yes, a bird was my best choice
  c'mon her passion drives her. Would u stop shooting if a bird flew down and pecked your arm off during a shoot? I think not!
  no I haven't. Kinda want to but kinda afraid that it will make me the mom that will never let her kids in the ocean.
  you don't need escape tactics if you just don't go in the ocean at all because there are horrible things living in there.

 Poor baby had her 2 month shots today. Made me cry when she turned bright red and started screaming in pain. Not fun for me or her!
  I'd be all over that myself, but not everyone drinks.
  I feel that way too but I don't want it to be sweets since there's a dessert bar. What could I do thats not full of sugar?
 whats a good favor for a baby shower? No sweets because we're offering a huge dessert bar at the shower and it would be overkill.
 It's national pie day? Mmmm pie! I love pie.
 Can't believe my baby is already 2 months old.
  lol. That's funny.
  awesome. I'll check your site when I get home and get on that!
  hey there! Thinking of doing pushcakes for a babyshower. Is it possible to order a few flavors to try & have you ship to me?

  the new explorer xlt
 Wasted a whole day yesterday buying a new car. Spent the night returning new car cause the salesman lied to us about it. Back to square 1.
 I'm so hungry but the baby has been asleep on my stomach for 2 hrs & she's so sweet & peaceful, I just can't move her. So I sit & starve...
 Off to get paint samples and then to the car dealership.
  that  had a great game!
 At the  game.
 Anyone have a ford explorer? looked at the 2011 & am deciding between that & a GMC Acadia. Looking for personal experiences w/ either 1.
 Date night tonight. Dinner and the  game. Nana's watching the baby.

 Neighbor is learning to play the drums. FML.
