  agreed, but I want more beyond the research and network of a phone. 
  We have failed if by choosing that tool we allow the focus to be on consuption. Not the tool's fault. 
  In those cases are the developing as learners? Yes Network, but are they creating 
  Awesome.  
  No worries, the reference was more about Tablet PC that Lenovo.
  I hope you are right about being out of Net biz in 5yr. Our society needs more access 
  But that is not a scalable solution for the masses, unfortunately.
  Agreed :-)  
 Sorry, I feel that there is nothing limiting about a single device. Sure, I'd love 2 issue 1 of everything to everybody, but cant 
  Agreed, but I see more value in a common tool with a wealth of potential for learning. 
  Guess I'd need to see how it works. 
  Why do you think I am limiting access. 
  yes, but to me the tools are non physical. Pick one device as a medium, but use to Resrch,Collabor,Cre8,present,network 
  Yes, but buffet of tech is more challenging and expensive. The tools arent important 
  It is nice t have access to all those tools, but unrealistic. My thoughts are if the kids can have just one device 
   Not sure what that looks like. Sounds like Batman' belt ;-)
  Too often I have seen the inconvenience as an obstacle and many dont push to overcome.  
  I think the tools create opptys to transform education 
  Is that bc they all have access at home? Is that the norm for all students, though.
  Yes but when do they get access to it. I want learning to drive the access not timing and schedules
  I am saying just a phone is not enough. Need something else, which can be a Tab. Yes.
 Access to net is critical - RT   would buying mass data plans beat buying iPads? 
  Yes, but I harder to get access to many devices, esp desktop
  I think you are misreading me...Phone not suff. Tab or Lap is sufficient
  For what I want them to do, yes more than phone.  Working out math, programming creatig high-level multimedia prod 
   Yes, I understand fo many phone is access to internet, but I want mor for students than just access to internet 
  Agreed, but I think you need something more than a phone.

 But that it is still OK for me to ask them 
 For me the challenge has always been to convince kids that not every problem has a simple answer.

  yes. although there can be others specific to course 
  Luxury of a gr8 mission where the pilars are so critical to learning  
  Not tyically, when they are math problems. It tends to be more the journey that I ultimately grade. 
  Typically only Newton, Euler or Leibniz if they can reach them. 
  So I sell starters or redirects & take off a few pts. (Which really dont ever matter, but don't tell them :-) 
  b/c the problems I assign R such stretches, many kids may leave it blank. ...
  I don't get why we used 65% of the numbers to say how bad you failed and only 10% to express highest achievement 
  I've always interacted w kids during assessments, so both. But kid w kid is harder.  
  Not sure what you mean, but no I think all assignments can have rubrics based on R mission and recorded with commentary. 
  I'd like to think I was on fire there too. :-) 
 Also for me, most of my assessments are collab...which is hard to do during an "exam"  
  luv Mission->grades. Sugg we change R gradebooks 2 have categories of Disc, Innov, Collab, & Excel

  agreed, but I want more beyond the research and network of a phone. 
  We have failed if by choosing that tool we allow the focus to be on consuption. Not the tool's fault. 
  In those cases are the developing as learners? Yes Network, but are they creating 
  Awesome.  
  No worries, the reference was more about Tablet PC that Lenovo.
  I hope you are right about being out of Net biz in 5yr. Our society needs more access 
  But that is not a scalable solution for the masses, unfortunately.
  Agreed :-)  
 Sorry, I feel that there is nothing limiting about a single device. Sure, I'd love 2 issue 1 of everything to everybody, but cant 
  Agreed, but I see more value in a common tool with a wealth of potential for learning. 
  Guess I'd need to see how it works. 
  Why do you think I am limiting access. 
  yes, but to me the tools are non physical. Pick one device as a medium, but use to Resrch,Collabor,Cre8,present,network 
  Yes, but buffet of tech is more challenging and expensive. The tools arent important 
  It is nice t have access to all those tools, but unrealistic. My thoughts are if the kids can have just one device 
   Not sure what that looks like. Sounds like Batman' belt ;-)
  Too often I have seen the inconvenience as an obstacle and many dont push to overcome.  
  I think the tools create opptys to transform education 
  Is that bc they all have access at home? Is that the norm for all students, though.
  Yes but when do they get access to it. I want learning to drive the access not timing and schedules
  I am saying just a phone is not enough. Need something else, which can be a Tab. Yes.
 Access to net is critical - RT   would buying mass data plans beat buying iPads? 
  Yes, but I harder to get access to many devices, esp desktop
  I think you are misreading me...Phone not suff. Tab or Lap is sufficient
  For what I want them to do, yes more than phone.  Working out math, programming creatig high-level multimedia prod 
   Yes, I understand fo many phone is access to internet, but I want mor for students than just access to internet 
  Agreed, but I think you need something more than a phone.
