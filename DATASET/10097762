 Wow, women really got a bad rap in these old STD propaganda posters:  (via 
 can't be certain, but I think the person who just left me a voice mail was taken by aliens mid call. Now I'll never know what they wanted!
 Where has this summer gone? I found myself this morning thinking about which weekend would work best to winterize the cabin come fall. Sad.
 Off to work a bit early today after a quick stop at  coffee. Now to launch a big  prolect with

 Stopped by sanchez bistro for happy hour, wishing a student worker well on her last day in the office.

 home from a long weekend in northeast Michigan with the  much needed break before the crazy week ahead.

 Looking forward to starting season 4 of Dexter this evening...finally available on Netflix!
 meeting  for lunch and a quick tech support session to help someone with their website.
 I must've had some crazy dreams last night. I woke up with Warren G's Regulators stuck in my head. Sadly, my itunes library has no Warren G.
 I love this cooler weather...Holly & I enjoyed a nice walk w/ the dog followed by dinner with fresh vegetables from a friend's garden. yum.
 Heading to Indiana to visit with family. Too bad it sounds like we're in for a hot and rainy day.
 going to an office social function on an old paddle boat... I guess that is one way to keep everyone socializing in one place.
 There's a big platter of donuts on the check-in desk at the rec center. Is that supposed to be a cruel joke tempting the people working out?
 Working from home for a bit then heading to the  Allendale campus; mtg w/ Climbing Center. Public safety & Development mtgs on deck.

 The office is HOPPING today...hopefully the issues we've seen today aren't a sign of what this week has in store for the 
 so little to do on this rainy day, & with no cable my TV options are limited. I just found myself stopping to watch "worship for shut ins."
 New blog post: Just what the doctor ordered for a long afternoon. 
 enjoyed nice dinner w/ a friend from college, in the same line of work, at the Greenwell. Nice to trade work-stories & brainstorm solutions!

 Enjoyed a fantastic dinner in Rockford at Red's on the River. Dessert wasn't too shabby either.
 Just voted, now grabbing a  coffee on the way to the office. Two of my favorite things ;)
 One of my many pet peeves: when businesses don't return sales calls. Sales must be REALLY good when you can afford to turn down more money.
 Too busy...I'm just not ready for it to be noon yet. On the up side...met some great  students interested in joining the

  is my hero this afternoon. despite being very busy, he made time to help w/ a client's long overdue changes...all for beer.
 My office is a real mess. Time to purge many stacks of paper & coffee cups; I think the janitor avoids my space, not knowing what to clean.
   Too much cup under lid ;) If you pick it up above half-cup mark the top contorts & pops lid. Poor match 4 car cup holder.
 Need coffee! I want  super size but grande is safer. Super size doesn't come w/ super lid; spilled 2 cups in my lap in last 3 tries.
 Fantastic...ipads finally arrived!
