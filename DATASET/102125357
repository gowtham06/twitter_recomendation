   that's one issue, but the larger issue is that 5-star ratings were being abused to help/hurt certain extensions.
  So, like iTunes' App Store?
  Ratings or reviews?
  still though, what is the difference between 3 stars and 4?  Even Netflix & YouTube are having similar issues with ratings.
  Code encryption is key.  Definitely not 100% effective, but 80%+ is better than nothing.  :)
  100% agree.
  Reviews make sense.  But do ratings add any value?  What is the difference b/t 1 and 5 stars and weren't most users gaming it?
  Good idea.  Do you have any specific tags you'd like to see?
