 Hi there new follows: looking forward to tweeting with you! have a wonderful week!
 Yep! & PuSH "pushes" ur content 2 search engines when u post (b/f waiting for the search engines 2 crawl/search at a given time) 
 a lot of times ppl think  is making it to the top of a list vs ranking well w/in your content/keywords   (u can get both)
 if u post regularly, you have a better rate of maximizing your   
 knowing the keywords ppl look for within your arena helps - put those keywords w/in ur posts, page titles, and post titles   
 well not automatically. when you generate a post that info is "captured" in Internet land 
 you're welcome!   
 ur welcome! 
 You're welcome! great to tweet ya! Have an awesome week!

 oh!  
 good question - ha! RT  Is a reg participant in blogchat NOT a spammer 
 remember ur passion & why u started blogging   
 basically PUSHES your updated content. that's y frequent updates and relevant keywords help

 RT  chuckle at ppl using SM tools 2 badmouth SM tools. Funny how they nvr want 2 use hand-written letters & phone 4 this ;)

 RT  comments on blogs are like followers on Twitter. Engage with people and show interest in their thoughts. 
 and i'm finding thread that are interesting to me

 I think they all have setups for good  but ur content, meta tags, titles, keywords help  
 start w/ a webcam or video on ur digital camera. doesnt have to be super high quality   
 ur welcome!   
 RT  Guest posting is important. Even if it's not in ur usual niche. Put yourself out there. All you can do is learn. :) 
 Yep i find that too - once i have manageable themes for myself, it makes it easier    
 very true - how u market urself is ++ or -- !

 not much :) mobile setups, blog frequency, open forum   
 RT  whether you add 1 post a wk or 10 a wk, be consistant - your readers will get to know you and your blog

 Hi there new follows: looking forward to tweeting with you! have a wonderful week!
 Yep! & PuSH "pushes" ur content 2 search engines when u post (b/f waiting for the search engines 2 crawl/search at a given time) 
 a lot of times ppl think  is making it to the top of a list vs ranking well w/in your content/keywords   (u can get both)
 if u post regularly, you have a better rate of maximizing your   
 knowing the keywords ppl look for within your arena helps - put those keywords w/in ur posts, page titles, and post titles   
 well not automatically. when you generate a post that info is "captured" in Internet land 
 you're welcome!   
 ur welcome! 
 You're welcome! great to tweet ya! Have an awesome week!

 Totally Awesome  2nite!! Feel free to follow me & my blogs  &  
 oh!  
 good question - ha! RT  Is a reg participant in blogchat NOT a spammer 
 remember ur passion & why u started blogging   
 basically PUSHES your updated content. that's y frequent updates and relevant keywords help   
 WP now has PuSH instead of waiting for next refresh, it updates when u publish. And ur content, freq, keywords, links

 Gr8 link shared by my friend  "How to Gracefully Promote Yourself Online"    
 RT  chuckle at ppl using SM tools 2 badmouth SM tools. Funny how they nvr want 2 use hand-written letters & phone 4 this ;)
 start w/ a frequency that works for u. may need 2 scale up or down depends on ur interaction & readership   
 RT  comments on blogs are like followers on Twitter. Engage with people and show interest in their thoughts. 
 and i'm finding thread that are interesting to me   
 Trying to! using  and scrolling!

 RT  Preach. RT  Things I've learned: content comes easier when I don't over think the topic 
 I was at first! getting much better at it (for my other blogs)   
 Twitter always  my fingertips &  can do "quick promo" but add feed to FB for anyone who's spending time there   
 I think they all have setups for good  but ur content, meta tags, titles, keywords help  
 start w/ a webcam or video on ur digital camera. doesnt have to be super high quality   
 ur welcome!   
 RT  Guest posting is important. Even if it's not in ur usual niche. Put yourself out there. All you can do is learn. :) 
 Yep i find that too - once i have manageable themes for myself, it makes it easier    
 very true - how u market urself is ++ or -- !    
 I've always started w/my existing network and build off that. Topics ppl want & frequency helps!   
 not much :) mobile setups, blog frequency, open forum   
 RT  whether you add 1 post a wk or 10 a wk, be consistant - your readers will get to know you and your blog 
 I think it's good to see dif perspectives - ur just doing what ppl do anyway when they visit
