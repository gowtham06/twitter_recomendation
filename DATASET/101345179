  Hi Coral, thanks for spreading the word! Always to have help in sharing the good. ;)
  Thanks darling! What a lovely compliment. xo
 Turns out, there's plenty of room for you, and you're welcome as you are. What would happen if you acted on that knowing now?
 Writers, take notice: the brilliant  has the talent, heart, & generosity to make your writing more publishable. I just love her.
 Put your self and your work out there. You have no idea who's waiting, watching, and listening just for you.
 Just finished a kick-ass call with  love seeing you bright lights come together to collaborate!

  Thanks lady. So appreciated your lovely, thoughtful response! Excited for what's ahead for you.
  Well hello there, lady. How are ya?

  That's right, it's at two pm PST. Thanks for double-checking!

 Resisting temptation to activate the fastest solution, reworking the entire system for the best one.
 Your mistakes can deepen your commitment, and strengthen your relationships with customers. It's all in how you hold them.

  She's good isn't she? A mischievous rebel in our ranks. ;) cc: 
   I bet - that is one grand soundtrack to live to!
  Exactly. ;) How was your time off, lady?
 New post! Have you been faking it? The real balance of humility, bigness, and accepting your genius.
 Been working on some fabulous new presents for my readers, cannot WAIT to share. Getting antsy.
 Which internal soundtrack are you playing? You get to choose, so play a tune that helps you revel in your own gorgeous nature.
  Hey you! A funny combo of places for the month - Vermont, Belize, LA. Sounds odd doesn't it?
  Oh, I love that! Good for you darling, how perfect. ;)
  Thanks! So very true. ;)
 I am one happy woman. Finally did enough traveling to be thrilled to come home. Huh-lo, PDX!
  Yep. She looks happy.
 Just bumped into Alanis Morisette. A happy 90's throwback moment.
 Love the Hollywood Bowl - quality sister time at  2nd row boxes. The best! 
  Thank you darling! Nice to be back, had a revelatory trip for the mastermind. ;)
 LAX, you and I see way too much of each other. Let's take some space. xo
  Mwah*****
  Thanks Rebecca! Great to be connected. ;)
  lovely! Always happy to grow my PDX circle too. ;)
 Elated. Soaking up equatorial sun for the next 48 hours, and no one knows where I am. Happy Sunday!
 And after all this time, the Sun has never said to the Earth,

 I have been under a rock. Never taking a vacation again.
 How did you keep that a secret?!? You are gooood.  cc:  and all the powerhouses.
 Just... speechless. Love my people. How incredible are they?
 Oh, WOW. Deeply moved, thank you.  Ode to Increase  {Special tribute to  + 
  So very true! ;)
 The trouble w/ vacations is that you're not supposed to work on them. I miss my people and projects. *sneaks on to Twitter...*
 Bless your competitors. They educate your audience for you, & highlight the need for your own incredible work. There's enough for everyone.
 If it ain’t a hell yes, it’s a hell no. You get to say "no," without an excuse. How else will you get to say "YES!" when it matters?
 Gonna celebrate my papa's bday today with really good scotch, and ruminate on collective legacy. Lucky to have learned so much from him.
 If we were together, I’d give you an eskimo kiss and a kick in the pants.
 Your clients deserve the real you - hedging your bets is half-assing it, my loves.
 Ever get that tingly-top-of-the-head feeling? It’s your genius, saying “hi.”
 Mmm... your world is *waiting* for you, your vision is calling you.
 Time to become an expert on how your talent expresses itself - what's it like, when you're working at your best?
 Check this out - the lady is gooood. RT  Announcing my new coaching package, Irresistible Creativity! 
  I just like the concept of blue toe polish for you. That fits. <3
 Freak thunderstorms and lightning around my head. Think I should get off the phone?
 Darling, anxiety is simply excitement with no place to go.
  Loved it too! So fitting. Cc: 
  Don't tempt me, darling! A friend just moved back to Bangkok, that part of the world is looking very good right now! cc 
  Thanks for passing that along. ;)
  LOL! Glad you liked that one. ;)
  Hey you! Long time no tweet. Have you giggled yet today?
 Hey my serious, visionary darlings - hysterical giggling is also revolutionary behavior. Just sayin'.
  Thanks Chrissy! Nice to have help in sharing that reminder. ;)
 Finally giving my book the lovin' it deserves - via Book Breakthru NYC w/  &  Who's going? 
  It's in the works, darling. I'll let you know. ;)
  Ha! I will - with all of these  in AUS and thereabouts, I have no more excuses. ;)
  Woop! You go, darling. xo
  Ha! Or any other time, for that matter. ;)
 Holy smokes. Reading Powerhouse MM intros & getting goosebumps. They came to bring it. Not to play big, to BE big. Love them already. 
  Right? Such a helpful shortcut. BTW, how do you do it? I'm stopping coaching to make room for the big projects, and it's haaard.
  lol - glad to hear it! Was reminding myself to keep it simple and start where I am, thought I'd spread the love. ;)
 Plug in - you already have what it takes, within you or within arm’s reach.
 Stand at your full height in every respect. Notice what changes. (Mmm... doesn't that feel good?)
  Oh W, all the way for me. And the Economist after. Sssshhh... Don't tell anyone it goes in that order! Stale biscotti?
  Love that we're on the same wavelength. ;)
  Oh, it's my pleasure, lady! ;)
  Woop! Another fellow travel devotee?? Velcome, darling, to the virtual powerhouse airport lounge. Care for some bad espresso?
 My airport is my cathedral. Runways are my center aisle to the divine, and altars are everywhere. 
 I bring my passport when flying stateside, & spend my entire boarding time obsessing about which intn'l flight to hop on. A gypsy possessed.
   Ships passing in the night again... just coming on. ;) One of these days, let's have a proper chat!
  Uh Hunh. ;)
 Forget the tepid disclaimers, I just want to see the real you.
 However you’re stalling out, just let it go. That’s only what’s happened until this moment. Everything can change right now.
  Lemme know what sticks out to ya the second time around - I'd be curious to know... 
  LOL - you got it lady. We're not doing anything else, right 
  Yup - we could right a book on that, couldn't we? ;)
  Aw, love that. Glad you found it helpful darling!
 Alignment first, then action. BIG action. ;)
 I. love. fireworks. It can't get dark fast enough for me!
  Oooh, purdy. I like it. ;)
  You said it, darlin'. Hope you enjoyed your boat ride!
 When you really commit to 1 vision, you’re making other dreams more possible, not less. Until you commit to somethin', nothing's possible.
 You are not something to be improved. Can we drop the "self improvement" metaphor, and go for something juicier? Let's rename this work.
 Writing a piece for  - doesn't take much to tap into my inner revolutionary.
  Thanks, you too! Dunno about you, but I needed the vitamin D stat, or I'd have to hop a plane to go soak some up. ;)
 Idyllic afternoon. Portlanders are buzzing lazily like honeybees drunk on sun nectar.
  Takes one to know one. :-*

  Darlin', I LOVE that for you. Looking forward to seeing what's next for you and your biz. Big love. 
 Authenticity is not the same as disclosure - you can be personal *and* professional in your brand. (Your audience will thank you for it!)
  LOL! I love that. At least mine wasn't pie. Hey, you and I need to talk. Look for an email... ;)
  Of *course* you would say that! The sweetheart, for sure. ;)
  Yep - put that way, who wouldn't find that appealing?   cc: 
  Yeahhh, that's what I'm leaning towards. How will he know anyway?
  Thank you Karim - a beautiful turn of phrase as usual from you!
  I think you're giving him too much credit. Or me. Can't tell. ;)
 I just bought my sweetheart a burrito. But then I ate half. Better to eat the rest or give a half-gift? Votes please.

 Oh, WOW. Deeply moved, thank you.  Ode to Increase  {Special tribute to  + 
  So very true! ;)
 The trouble w/ vacations is that you're not supposed to work on them. I miss my people and projects. *sneaks on to Twitter...*
 Bless your competitors. They educate your audience for you, & highlight the need for your own incredible work. There's enough for everyone.
 If it ain’t a hell yes, it’s a hell no. You get to say "no," without an excuse. How else will you get to say "YES!" when it matters?
 Gonna celebrate my papa's bday today with really good scotch, and ruminate on collective legacy. Lucky to have learned so much from him.
 If we were together, I’d give you an eskimo kiss and a kick in the pants.
 Your clients deserve the real you - hedging your bets is half-assing it, my loves.
 Ever get that tingly-top-of-the-head feeling? It’s your genius, saying “hi.”
 Mmm... your world is *waiting* for you, your vision is calling you.
 Time to become an expert on how your talent expresses itself - what's it like, when you're working at your best?

  Thanks for passing that along. ;)
  LOL! Glad you liked that one. ;)
  Hey you! Long time no tweet. Have you giggled yet today?
 Hey my serious, visionary darlings - hysterical giggling is also revolutionary behavior. Just sayin'.
  Thanks Chrissy! Nice to have help in sharing that reminder. ;)
 Finally giving my book the lovin' it deserves - via Book Breakthru NYC w/  &  Who's going? 
  It's in the works, darling. I'll let you know. ;)
  Ha! I will - with all of these  in AUS and thereabouts, I have no more excuses. ;)
  Woop! You go, darling. xo
  Ha! Or any other time, for that matter. ;)
 Holy smokes. Reading Powerhouse MM intros & getting goosebumps. They came to bring it. Not to play big, to BE big. Love them already. 
  Right? Such a helpful shortcut. BTW, how do you do it? I'm stopping coaching to make room for the big projects, and it's haaard.
  lol - glad to hear it! Was reminding myself to keep it simple and start where I am, thought I'd spread the love. ;)
 Plug in - you already have what it takes, within you or within arm’s reach.
 Stand at your full height in every respect. Notice what changes. (Mmm... doesn't that feel good?)

  Love that we're on the same wavelength. ;)
  Oh, it's my pleasure, lady! ;)
  Woop! Another fellow travel devotee?? Velcome, darling, to the virtual powerhouse airport lounge. Care for some bad espresso?
 My airport is my cathedral. Runways are my center aisle to the divine, and altars are everywhere. 
 I bring my passport when flying stateside, & spend my entire boarding time obsessing about which intn'l flight to hop on. A gypsy possessed.
   Ships passing in the night again... just coming on. ;) One of these days, let's have a proper chat!
  Uh Hunh. ;)
 Forget the tepid disclaimers, I just want to see the real you.
 However you’re stalling out, just let it go. That’s only what’s happened until this moment. Everything can change right now.
  Lemme know what sticks out to ya the second time around - I'd be curious to know... 
  LOL - you got it lady. We're not doing anything else, right 
  Yup - we could right a book on that, couldn't we? ;)
  Aw, love that. Glad you found it helpful darling!
 Alignment first, then action. BIG action. ;)
 I. love. fireworks. It can't get dark fast enough for me!
  Oooh, purdy. I like it. ;)
  You said it, darlin'. Hope you enjoyed your boat ride!
 When you really commit to 1 vision, you’re making other dreams more possible, not less. Until you commit to somethin', nothing's possible.
 You are not something to be improved. Can we drop the "self improvement" metaphor, and go for something juicier? Let's rename this work.

  I think you're giving him too much credit. Or me. Can't tell. ;)
