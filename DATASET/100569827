 ...................... maybe I'm expressing myself on the wrong social network :/
 I follow alot of people... obviously i'm interested in what most of you have to say. you know... "How's life been" & all that & whatever...
 If someone follows you, I think they should show some interest as to what you share or how you express yourself....
 Random: I've only asked for a follow back once. But I never really ask... It seems quite pointless to me... that's pretty much it.
   you're welcome :)
  Good Morning =)

 And so that's just what I do .
 If you think a girl is pretty, let her know :) Simple as that .
 I tell a lot of women how beautiful they are. Not just because it's the truth, but why hold it in?

  thanks again man.
 THAT is the perfect example of EVERYTHING I TWEETED THIS MORNING. And you sound horrible btw....
  so instead of working on a solo that's going to be performed in about 4 or 5 days, you waste time playing useless nonsense?!
 I finally talked to someone who could actually relate to everything I said I felt and actually give me good advice on past experience.

 RT  Men, y'all niggas to emotional go back to Richmond & let mommy give u a hug, if not shut the fuck up & just get Ya work dne
  HBCU Band Consortium... It's like a convention for hbcu band programs. Concert, performances, classes & such...
  but it just seems like we all can't come together as one and agree to actually handle it... and see it through.
  Not even saying they're the main reasons, but they are some we can actually take the time to fix ourselves...
  true and there isn't really a definite place where blame can actually be put, but these are a few major problems.
  We leave on wednesday and we'll be coming back Sunday.
 Can't even look at this Atlanta trip in a good way....
  yes
  yes
 So when I say I can't be here, II'm saying I can't be around so much [ idgaf cause I'm the shit whether I sound good or bad ] influence.
 And quite honestly, I'm sick of sounding like shit.
 It's just that this music program has SO MUCH POTENTIAL TO BE FAR GREATER THAN WHAT IT IS, BUT NO STUDENTS ARE ATTEMPTING TO RAISE THE BAR.
 And in actuality, the music program isn't all that bad....
 Don't get me wrong, we have awesome professors here who are absolutely incredible at what they do...
 No one here seems to care about true musicianship... at least that what's reflected in our program.
  Norfolk State
 .... at least you know you eligible for that job as a professional marching band member after graduation. oh wait, they don't have those.
 ..... at least you know everybody know bout yo band.
 ... at least you know you can march down a street in your school colors for a living.
 .... at least you can scream really really high notes and everyone knows it's you.
 ... and everybody can dance and play a horn really loud.
 ... but at least the marching band loud.
 And everybody knows this, yet no one here has really taken it into consideration, and it's because no one really cares....
 ... and even though there are the people that sound good, in general, the group gone sound like some straight shit.
 Everyone has to put in work for the ensemble to sound great, otherwise it's just gone be a few good people & a few bad people...
 What is really shocking is that even that everyone is satisfied with the D-...... This is what it feels like here (to me).
 And so everyone goes back to the same routine bullshit that hinders the team from progression. And instead of an A+, the group gets a D-.
 It's like a teacher gives you a group project and everybody knows what they have to do to get the A+, but no one truly cares...
 Everyone has all these great dreams but when time comes to, everything learned becomes forgotten and all thats left is a heap of bad habits.
 My area of study (music) requires much TEAMWORK. But it seems as though nobody has the determination to progress.
 Like, I can't be here.... At NSU.... any longer. Not knocking the institution at all, but.... allow me to elaborate.
  good morning =)
 (really considering transferring.)
 Being at Villanova University this past weekend really allowed me to see Good Musicianship on a much higher level.
