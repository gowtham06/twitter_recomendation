 Today, take a minute to just thank the Lord for what he has done and humbly prepare for what he will do next
 It is a matter of being humble enough for the Lord to bless you, and smart enough to be thankful when he does.
 Success is knowing that success is not about you.
 It is the Lord who numbers our days. It is the Lord who directs our paths. It is the Lord who gives us strength to work hard.
 The true secret to success is having the humility to know that all success comes from the Lord.
 "LUCKY" people are humbled that the Lord chose them to show favor to.
 A key component to success is understanding that success comes from the Lord and being able to humbly submit to his will

 RT   IM A BOSS FREESTYLE   WEEK 4
 Today, take a minute to just thank the Lord for what he has done and humbly prepare for what he will do next
 It is a matter of being humble enough for the Lord to bless you, and smart enough to be thankful when he does.
 Success is knowing that success is not about you.
 It is the Lord who numbers our days. It is the Lord who directs our paths. It is the Lord who gives us strength to work hard.
 The true secret to success is having the humility to know that all success comes from the Lord.
 "LUCKY" people are humbled that the Lord chose them to show favor to.
 A key component to success is understanding that success comes from the Lord and being able to humbly submit to his will
