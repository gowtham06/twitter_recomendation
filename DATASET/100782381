  Yikes - hope things turn out alright!
  Lol Well, I will practice and share.
 Oh, wow. I have 5 or 6 posts that need to go up this week.  Where am I going to find the time for this.
  Haha it took me a while but yeah it's funny.. better out loud, when you can emphasize - "..an ARMy.."

  I've watched the movie and read the book - both are great (book is better, though).  JGL is fantastic.
  Lol - Congrats on finishing, though - I've started a few times.  Haven't finished anything yet. Sigh.
  Hah - true. Great way to get your book read, too.
  Okay.. I'm game.
  Haha.. Yes - but the statement applies generally, and I don't want to be "mean."
   I'll be uploading a picture for you soon... if I can ever get my phone to work.
  Need help?  :)
     Just another reason why not to judge a book by its cover. :)
  Your new tattoo - bold and brave. Much respect for you and grateful for the support. Thank you.
 Just because someone is a New York Times Best-Selling Author does not mean their book is any good.
 On page 186 of 309 of The Vast Fields of Ordina..., by Nick Burd 
  It's a very good book - clever, sweet, sad and funny.  Very quick read, too (considering most pages are just a few sentences).
 HP & The Deathly Hallows p. 2 was even better the second time around.  Did my part to push ticket sales over $1 Billion today. Worth it!
 I can't make sense of str8 men who like poetry.  It's turning into a neurosis... seems somehow antithetical to universal atlas of things.

  Son of Neptune by Rick Riordan!
  Yep! My new job/schedule messed me up this month as well.
  Well, it's an assumption I'm comfortable with and an opinion I'm entitled to have. :]
  Not well at all.
 I have only read one book in the month of July. Hoping to finish another today.... this is a disaster.
  So you, me, and the U.S. government are all in the same boat. :)
  Obviously. But completely botching the casting is inexcusable, and I believe they're way off-base here.
  Lol agreed, all around.
  And too...  I dunno.  Gale and Peeta both have a soft, sensual beauty to them.  These guys are just "dudes."
  I'm not sure I could be more disappointed. Lol 
  
  I think they've given up. Lol  I went in last week and movies that were out of place (in a book section) still there today.
 Wow.. the actors playing Peeta and Gale in The Hunger Games movie adaptation? TOTAL FAIL.  Not at all what I would imagine/choose.
  I know! Very frustrating - they've given up. Understandable.. but I can't find anything.

 Just because someone is a New York Times Best-Selling Author does not mean their book is any good.

  It's a very good book - clever, sweet, sad and funny.  Very quick read, too (considering most pages are just a few sentences).
 HP & The Deathly Hallows p. 2 was even better the second time around.  Did my part to push ticket sales over $1 Billion today. Worth it!
 I can't make sense of str8 men who like poetry.  It's turning into a neurosis... seems somehow antithetical to universal atlas of things.

  Son of Neptune by Rick Riordan!
  Yep! My new job/schedule messed me up this month as well.
  Well, it's an assumption I'm comfortable with and an opinion I'm entitled to have. :]
  Not well at all.
 I have only read one book in the month of July. Hoping to finish another today.... this is a disaster.
  So you, me, and the U.S. government are all in the same boat. :)
  Obviously. But completely botching the casting is inexcusable, and I believe they're way off-base here.
  Lol agreed, all around.
  And too...  I dunno.  Gale and Peeta both have a soft, sensual beauty to them.  These guys are just "dudes."
  I'm not sure I could be more disappointed. Lol 
  
  I think they've given up. Lol  I went in last week and movies that were out of place (in a book section) still there today.
 Wow.. the actors playing Peeta and Gale in The Hunger Games movie adaptation? TOTAL FAIL.  Not at all what I would imagine/choose.
  I know! Very frustrating - they've given up. Understandable.. but I can't find anything.

  It's a very good book - clever, sweet, sad and funny.  Very quick read, too (considering most pages are just a few sentences).
 HP & The Deathly Hallows p. 2 was even better the second time around.  Did my part to push ticket sales over $1 Billion today. Worth it!

  Not well at all.
 I have only read one book in the month of July. Hoping to finish another today.... this is a disaster.
  So you, me, and the U.S. government are all in the same boat. :)
  Obviously. But completely botching the casting is inexcusable, and I believe they're way off-base here.
  Lol agreed, all around.
  And too...  I dunno.  Gale and Peeta both have a soft, sensual beauty to them.  These guys are just "dudes."
  I'm not sure I could be more disappointed. Lol 
  
  I think they've given up. Lol  I went in last week and movies that were out of place (in a book section) still there today.
 Wow.. the actors playing Peeta and Gale in The Hunger Games movie adaptation? TOTAL FAIL.  Not at all what I would imagine/choose.
