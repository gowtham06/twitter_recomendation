   If you are going in the right direction you can't go wrong. Thanks to all the followers and readers
 Keep it real  means be honest with yourself then you can be honest with others don't lie 2 me you have 2 live with it
  We can't SEE for LOOKING, we tell the President how to do his job but we can't do ours without asking him (dumb rite)
 Happy Sunday  if you want a better life you work for it, if you want a better economy you work harder for it
  Each day I get up give thanks pray for all mankind & put my best efford into my day. Think about others first
 New day to try bringing our lives in agreement with the rest of the world   thank you been having signal issues
 
  thank you all for follow take time to check us out new and improved
 N order 2 reach your goal set your own pace not follow someone else's  N life/weight loss whatever
  time is not on your side, you can't stop/move/increase it, all you have is all you get use wisely
 If someone give you a raw deal find a good way to cook it 
  Main St./Wall St. don't matter we live together in this world, we need to work together, a large village needed
 If you only see light at end of tunnel you are in the dark come into the light and you will shine  and see clearly
 Every now and then count your own blessing not someone else  grass not always greener on other side
  Life has many roads, watch/read all signs you may need to exit on an unfamiliar road where you are going
 With my family
  If you have family you have peace if you have love you have more peace have peace and love
  every now and then life gives you a chance to make a difference make a choice now or then
  GM twit family after flying from west to east we have no choice but to change for the earth have already
 Each day is a blessing if you open your eyes/heart/mind to life good and bad for each day bring a change 
 If you spend your time wisely you will know how to make money to provide a way of life, not old way  new lease on life
 Thank you for following
 GM tweeters thank U for follow  we R working hard 2 make a difference w/family & world ck us out, work hard for right.
 When we learn 2 live as people not classed upper, middle, lower, black, white, foreign the problems will be solved 
 Are we still waiting for the old way of life or are we moving forward?  Weight broke the wagon down!!
  
  (Here's a cool YouTube video)
 
 We have come to far to give up now, so we must move forward, keep trying until we get there it is worth the price 
 Happy safe 4th of July  be aware of ur surroundings people, animal and everything that moves
 I've enjoyed the info love the water and fishing thank you
 The road of life is no fun when down the road awaits the knowledge you never made the right turns.  Ck: 
 We can start our life on the right road but still end up in the wrong direction watch where you are going 
 Life is full of shoulda, coulda, woulda, if, and, maybe instead how about doing it now, give it a try. 
   Tworld things will change with/without you, your input/put up, better/worse it must change or it will die, let's live
 Life gets busy make U forget what U R doing. LOL ck:  Thank you all for the follows this from my heart
 What's in your heart comes out your mouth truthfully.  Pay attention to your heart and listen to your mouth.
 Things/times r not bad but people r doing/saying everything 2 keep us all in the dark ages we need 2 work 2gether. Ck: 
 History will remain the same if we as people don't change. How do we see ourselves years 1951-2010? 
  Each day is a wake-up call 2 make things happen in ur life not wait for things 2 happen in ur life, see/reach/attain
 Happy Father's Day tworld 
 
 A father's love is not always from ur father but its still love, don't forget the love 
 Life continues long after other people think you have no life or deserves one don't stop living 
 Funny how everyone can do your job better than you, jobs from the President of U.S. to your mother.
 Funny how everyone can do your job better than you, jobs from the President of U.S. to your mother.

  thank you all for follow take time to check us out new and improved
 N order 2 reach your goal set your own pace not follow someone else's  N life/weight loss whatever
  time is not on your side, you can't stop/move/increase it, all you have is all you get use wisely
 If someone give you a raw deal find a good way to cook it 
  Main St./Wall St. don't matter we live together in this world, we need to work together, a large village needed
 If you only see light at end of tunnel you are in the dark come into the light and you will shine  and see clearly
 Every now and then count your own blessing not someone else  grass not always greener on other side
  Life has many roads, watch/read all signs you may need to exit on an unfamiliar road where you are going
 With my family
  If you have family you have peace if you have love you have more peace have peace and love
  every now and then life gives you a chance to make a difference make a choice now or then
  GM twit family after flying from west to east we have no choice but to change for the earth have already
 Each day is a blessing if you open your eyes/heart/mind to life good and bad for each day bring a change 
 If you spend your time wisely you will know how to make money to provide a way of life, not old way  new lease on life
 Thank you for following
 GM tweeters thank U for follow  we R working hard 2 make a difference w/family & world ck us out, work hard for right.
 When we learn 2 live as people not classed upper, middle, lower, black, white, foreign the problems will be solved 
 Are we still waiting for the old way of life or are we moving forward?  Weight broke the wagon down!!
  
  (Here's a cool YouTube video)
 
 We have come to far to give up now, so we must move forward, keep trying until we get there it is worth the price 
 Happy safe 4th of July  be aware of ur surroundings people, animal and everything that moves
 I've enjoyed the info love the water and fishing thank you
 The road of life is no fun when down the road awaits the knowledge you never made the right turns.  Ck: 
 We can start our life on the right road but still end up in the wrong direction watch where you are going 
 Life is full of shoulda, coulda, woulda, if, and, maybe instead how about doing it now, give it a try. 
   Tworld things will change with/without you, your input/put up, better/worse it must change or it will die, let's live
 Life gets busy make U forget what U R doing. LOL ck:  Thank you all for the follows this from my heart
 What's in your heart comes out your mouth truthfully.  Pay attention to your heart and listen to your mouth.
 Things/times r not bad but people r doing/saying everything 2 keep us all in the dark ages we need 2 work 2gether. Ck: 
 History will remain the same if we as people don't change. How do we see ourselves years 1951-2010? 
  Each day is a wake-up call 2 make things happen in ur life not wait for things 2 happen in ur life, see/reach/attain
 Happy Father's Day tworld 
 
 A father's love is not always from ur father but its still love, don't forget the love 
 Life continues long after other people think you have no life or deserves one don't stop living 
 Funny how everyone can do your job better than you, jobs from the President of U.S. to your mother.
