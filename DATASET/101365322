 7 stories of successful young entrepreneurs-- it's more than money!
 Your Solo venture formula is VALUE+ ENGAGEMENT+ Fair EXCHANGE! (and after you test, retry the formula)
 EXCHANGE is the heart of business-- for the great value  u offer u charge money (or time, or favors). Whtever it is, don't be afraid to ask!
 ENGAGE means to take a risk (ask, put ur stuff out there), and to pay attention to feedback (use feedback to test- dont let it frighten u!)
 We create VALUE when we pay attention to the needs in our community: walk a person, clean their yard, read to someone, prepare a simple dish
 I teach kids three simple steps to start a little business: create Value, Engage your audience, and offer a Fair Exchange (charge!)

 7 stories of successful young entrepreneurs-- it's more than money!
 Your Solo venture formula is VALUE+ ENGAGEMENT+ Fair EXCHANGE! (and after you test, retry the formula)
 EXCHANGE is the heart of business-- for the great value  u offer u charge money (or time, or favors). Whtever it is, don't be afraid to ask!
 ENGAGE means to take a risk (ask, put ur stuff out there), and to pay attention to feedback (use feedback to test- dont let it frighten u!)
 We create VALUE when we pay attention to the needs in our community: walk a person, clean their yard, read to someone, prepare a simple dish
 I teach kids three simple steps to start a little business: create Value, Engage your audience, and offer a Fair Exchange (charge!)
