  We're looking into it further now
  While there was a response to your ticket asking for more logs, I think you may be encountering a bug using external grammars.
  I'll check with support now on your ticket.
  Let us know if you have any further trouble; opening a support ticket is always an option as well.
  I'll check in to that, there should always be someone in the room, though they might've been sidetracked at the time.
  Looks like you didn't get a response - are you using a library with the REST API? Looks like the request is missing your acct ID.
  What's your Tropo username? We'll take a look.
  Try an app that is just "transfer('14155551212')" - call it and it transfers to that number. Like call forwarding.
  Sure. Call yourself first and then use transfer or conference to connect to other person. Or call in and transfer the call
  It's 3¢/min to use the platform. We throw in inbound and US outbound PSTN for free.
  Thanks! We agree. :)
  We haven't changed anything in our Twitter support in months. Looking into it. Sorry about that.
  That's odd indeed. Perhaps Twitter just finally gave us access to some extra tweets. They've been fiddling with the permissions.
  Tropo replies to incoming messages on the account you connect to it. Were you expecting something else?
  Same limits as paid accounts. We trust you know the difference between dev and production and trust you won't abuse it.
  Sure. Send what you're looking for over to support and we'll see if it's available.

  If you can find one, you can get a number directly and have them point it at your Tropo SIP address to use Tropo.
  You would need a local telco to offer VoIP services. From what I can tell, none in Anguilla do.
  Usually comes down to local telcos not being able to do the sorts of things we do.
  No, we have local phone numbers in 41 countries, but not much in Caribbean outside of Puerto Rico.
   17¢+ pricing is for voice traffic. SMS is 2¢ worldwide, 1¢ US. Can deliver to about 850 carriers worldwide.
