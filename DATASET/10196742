  When crazy tomato season hits, I do a bunch with red onion and olive and store in oil. Toss w/pasta & mozz, & dinner is done.
  Then roast at 300F for about an hour (or 20 minutes or so at 375). If you do a lot, you can store in olive oil.
  It's quite easy. For plum tomatoes, cut in 1/2 (quarters for larger tomatoes), give it a little oil, salt and pepper.
  roasted tomatoes are incredible with eggs and bacon.

 Attention:  and I are planning to take over the world. Sort of.  we should chat at    
 Learning about behavior modification techniques in class today. Feeling very sneaky at the moment.
 RT  They're remaking Footloose??! Why???
  which can only mean you're having a good day ;-)
 Rocking the black rain boots and my rain trench this afternoon for a meeting at Bentley. I totally feel like Christopher Robin.

  actually, check out the Tyvek wallets at Porter Square Books. Cheap, durable, & I got Nick one with plans for the USS Enterprise.
 Headed down to RI today to grill for my dad. 
  ah. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks for clarifying.
  the idea of my husband doing competitive couponing, & potentially the thought of ending up with infinite Vitamin Water & Mentos.
  Interesting. What kind of uncertainties?
 I'm still not sure how all this will work. But I'm disturbed.
 In even more disturbing news, Nick has decided to start "extreme couponing." With algorithms. And virtual machines.
  such as?
 Just started watching, on Nick's suggestion, "Extreme Couponing." This may be one of the most disturbing shows I've ever seen.
   As luck would have it, I HAVE a wisecracking sidekick! I will make sure to tell my husband as soon as he gets home.
  Wednesday is great before about 5pm EST.
  mweheheheh! Sounds good. How's Tuesday?
  ooooh!!!!! I totally wish I lived in NYC. Would SO go see Glee Live.
 Yes! Great chat with  about 960, grid systems, responsive design and breakfast tacos.  when do I get to chat w/you?
  I hated Thunderbird too.
 Spectacularly lacking in motivation today. May have to hit Harvard Square early instead of trying to work from home. Boo.
  Yep. It's annoying as hell, it is. Can't have cookies or cake, either. Sticking with fruit and Greek yogurt for now.
  I have to. Just for a while. It makes my head fuzzy and I get too tired to focus. NEED to focus right now :-(
 Dear chocolate: I love you, but you exhaust me. So I must say goodbye. I will miss you, old friend.
 It's life's paradoxes that fascinate me. Example: I'd get a lot more done if I didn't try to do so much.
 Are there any situations in life where Cee-Lo's "f*** you" can't make things better? I say NO.
 Hey! Any local homesteaders want to help beta test a project I'll be working on in the coming weeks?
  Also, life is all about balance.
  RIGHT???? I'm totally rationalizing this. Stoopid movies FTW!
  Towards what end? Are you thinking straight up communication, or student intranet?

  Have you thought about getting one of the gold filters for  Could save money and waste.
 As my intellectual pursuits gain traction, my taste in movies declines. Currently enjoying "Get him to the Greek" a bit too much.
 Today, apparently, is a Cleaning Day. The home office feels so much more sensible now.
 One odd feature of living in Watertown: the vast  of people who blast oldies out of their car. At least my neighbor sticks w/ the Beatles.
  depends on the client, I suppose. Maybe leave out the hangover bit?
 Dear Ethan Marcotte: I love you. Thank you for helping  make sense to me.
 Oh my goodness, just saw the book cover for my first  guide from  So bizarre that it's real, now.
 Man, that's some Thunder. Hope everyone stays safe around here!
 RT  15 y/o Alice is terminal with cancer & made a bucket list. She wants to trend on Twitter. Can we help her? 
 Damn, I love research and ideation. Most productive day I had in weeks, and there's still more to do tomorrow.

 New  Omega theme looks HOT: . HTML5 and responsive goodness! cc  
 Notes transcribed and sent off, homework done for Personality class; 4+ syllabi found for PLA. June is officially WAY TOO BUSY. 
 Is it wrong that I inherently distrust a syllabus for a course in "Effective Web Design" that lists FLASH as a primary course objective?
  I will be! See you there.
 Hey, any  themers or devs in the Boston area, let me know if you have time for projects. Have a couple of gigs that need good folks.

 Where'd that sexy new profile pic come from? From my good friend Sam Morse, photog extraordinaire. 
 RT  STEVE MARTIN IS REALLY OILED AND BUFF. OMG, my Twitter account was just hacked.
 Mom: "as I mentioned, I want to get my degree in theory-having." I love this woman.
  you should go! Will def. Be there; just not presenting.
  No worries. If you're available, will hook you up with the woman who is looking.
 After some reflection, have decided that my focus at this year's  will be on observing, not presenting.
  Sounds like it was a blast! Hope you enjoyed it.
  This site seems to have them as well: 
  Actually, I believe that Doc Martens has a vegan branch. I saw some at a shoe place in Porter Square, Cambridge.
 What we're up to this evening. 
  Why are you in Boston?

 It is *so* iced coffee time.
  they were great, actually. You may want to put just a bit of liqueur in them to soften.
  "considered letting new people in" is where I have to call BS. Why go to an event if you have the same people every year?
 Alas, looks like I won't be presenting in London this year. Back to writing the book, and more  love.
  made a lemon rosewater sorbet with mint that was delightful. Also, coconut milk sorbet with cardamom and rosewater is lovely.

 What is it about the first day of classes that makes me completely overwhelmed? Trying to write a chapter and doubting everything I write.
 When coffee shops play "Thriller," do you ever secretly wish the staff would just bust out into a zombie dance?
  This one is Theories of Personality. All about behavioral research. OOOOH SO FUN!
 Just took a couple of personality tests for class on Thursday. Apparently, I'm an extravert. 
 First day of summer classes, and I've been reading all about behavioral research and studying behavior. Yes, this is fun for me. 
 Finally got a resumé and starting UX portfolio off after way too long futzing over it. Now, dinner.
 Just got a call from  about a Very Interesting Side Project. Life will be fun for a while, methinks :-)
 Woman in front of me at Target is unloading every kind of processed junk known to man. Worst part? You can tell it's all for her kids.

 Me: "what does it mean to be human?" 5YO: "it's fine being human. Because I can jump and run and play, and all that." Well played, sir.
 Note to self: next time I garden all day, wear sunscreen.  
 RT  I still have no idea why so many designers do stuff like this one with CSS3 - 
  ah! Yes, that can be a tough one. The one lucky thing about being in school now is having to enforce time for reading.
 Off to see the family for a Memorial Day cookout. Bringing lentil salad and veggies for the grill. 
  the guides from a book apart on the subject are pretty great, and codekickoff will give you starter code to work with.
  hahaha. Let me know if you need a crash course. I've been focusing some energy on html5/css3 lately.
 Every semester, I feel a bit more like Hermione Granger. Already reading the book for my Personality Psych class.
 At long last, I have put together a patio garden for the summer. Greens, tomatoes, marjoram, parsley, beans, peas & strawberries.
 Signed up for Theories of Personality for a summer class. Just read the syllabus. Don't think I knew what I was signing up for. Hoo boy.

  I have heard that Samsung is coming out with a new Google tablet that's going to be Very Good.
   ah, so that's all it takes ;-)
 I think if I could eat Czech soups every day until the end of time, I would do that. Also, must make sauerkraut this season.
 Hotel soundtrack is on point tonight - first was "Oh Darling," now "In Your Eyes."
