   besides facebook and twitter can accomplish the same thing without the extra costs.
  it is good for a startup 1 time to just get people in the door and to get word out about business. Nothing more.
  terrible for coffee or small ticket shops. Discount is more than the actual cost of goods sold. Bad formula.
  agreed 100%
  also the discount destroys your margins. Consulting & pizza businesses do great with this advertising. Little to no cost.
  for any business that has a low averge ticket discounting your product will not help it. Find ways to increase it.
 This is exactly what I have heard RT  Groupon/ LivingSocial / BargainBee an easily harm your business

   besides facebook and twitter can accomplish the same thing without the extra costs.
  it is good for a startup 1 time to just get people in the door and to get word out about business. Nothing more.
  terrible for coffee or small ticket shops. Discount is more than the actual cost of goods sold. Bad formula.
  agreed 100%
  also the discount destroys your margins. Consulting & pizza businesses do great with this advertising. Little to no cost.
  for any business that has a low averge ticket discounting your product will not help it. Find ways to increase it.
 This is exactly what I have heard RT  Groupon/ LivingSocial / BargainBee an easily harm your business
