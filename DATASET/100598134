 Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.
 You can't put a limit on anything. The more you dream, the farther you get.
 Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.
 Love is like war: easy to begin but very hard to stop.
 All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.
