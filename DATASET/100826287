 Enough Hell jokes for now.
 In Hell, Tylenol isn't any more useful than it is on earth. It's completely useless on Earth already.
 In Hell, drugs (both recreational and medicinal) only give their side effects rather than intended effects.
 Hell's police harass, arrest and even kill innocent people, much like on Earth.
 Hell certainly has a fire department, but it only serves to maintain the fire rather than extinguish. It's best to not call 911.
 Hell uses a measurement system similar to metric, but based on 666 rather than 10.
 In Hell, the only social network is MySpace. And all profiles must have auto-playing shitty pop music.
 In Hell, all schools have uniforms, ban any remotely tasty food, and punish anyone who dares to be alive. Kinda like on Earth!
 In Hell, physical mail is actually delivered by snails. You won't notice a difference though.
 In Hell, the only TV stations are PBS and MTV, both of which suck.
 RT  I paid $30 for express shipping from the US, 4 working days later, nothing! 
 In Hell, all Web users must share a single 56k dialup connection and must watch Rick Roll vid 3x/day or else flames get hotter
 In Hell, you actually have to pay for all your music/movies. Satan & Steve Jobs made a deal. Satan gets 69%, Jobs 30%, musician 1% of profit
 In Hell, all roads are seemingly under construction indefinitely, much like here on Earth.
 Hell's politicians include Satan as president and his advisers are Hitler and Bush. Stalin helps redistribute the suffering.
 Hell's parking lot is all handicapped spaces, thereby preventing you from even using it. You're fucked before you even enter.

 School web filters block way more than the porn it was intended. news sites, blogs, etc the school board doesn't like = blocked. 
 Seriously... How can you truly support education when you block every information source that you don't like. Fuck  
 Schools and libraries should have no Internet filters whatsoever. Watching porn is bad but censoring 90% of the Internet is worse.

 Enough Hell jokes for now.
 In Hell, Tylenol isn't any more useful than it is on earth. It's completely useless on Earth already.
 In Hell, drugs (both recreational and medicinal) only give their side effects rather than intended effects.
 Hell's police harass, arrest and even kill innocent people, much like on Earth.
 Hell certainly has a fire department, but it only serves to maintain the fire rather than extinguish. It's best to not call 911.
 Hell uses a measurement system similar to metric, but based on 666 rather than 10.
 In Hell, the only social network is MySpace. And all profiles must have auto-playing shitty pop music.
 In Hell, all schools have uniforms, ban any remotely tasty food, and punish anyone who dares to be alive. Kinda like on Earth!
 In Hell, physical mail is actually delivered by snails. You won't notice a difference though.
 In Hell, the only TV stations are PBS and MTV, both of which suck.
 RT  I paid $30 for express shipping from the US, 4 working days later, nothing! 
 In Hell, all Web users must share a single 56k dialup connection and must watch Rick Roll vid 3x/day or else flames get hotter
 In Hell, you actually have to pay for all your music/movies. Satan & Steve Jobs made a deal. Satan gets 69%, Jobs 30%, musician 1% of profit
 In Hell, all roads are seemingly under construction indefinitely, much like here on Earth.
 Hell's politicians include Satan as president and his advisers are Hitler and Bush. Stalin helps redistribute the suffering.
 Hell's parking lot is all handicapped spaces, thereby preventing you from even using it. You're fucked before you even enter.
