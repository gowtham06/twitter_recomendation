 Have I mentioned how much I love Martha's Vineyard? Because I love it so much I'd marry it. And then I'd have an affair with the house here.
 Murgh. I miss Dutch Roomie :( Also today I learned that Popeye the Sailor Man is called Alfred in Sweden. WTF?
 On Martha's Vineyard! Lovely to be back in a NESN state for awhile.
 RT  Anyone else with an extra amount of time on there hands right about now?  
 I just ousted  as the mayor of Bangall Whaling Co. on  
 Leaving for a month on Martha's Vineyard tomorrow! But first, a very sad, very unplanned and very tear filled goodbye to Dutch Roomie. :(
 Win number 199 and 185 for Tim Wakefield! Just keep pitching, just keep pitching, just keep pitching...
 Well, now that I'm not obsessed with a bunch of guys biking around France I can get back to obsessing over the Red Sox. Happy 2000 Ks Wake!
 So bummed the Tour de France ends today.
 Dear Coworker: If you're going to come to work hungover as fuck don't spend the whole morning brag-whining about it. No one cares.
 RT  ON THIS DAY: In 2005 Lance Armstrong wins a record 7th Tour de France and retires from cycling
  Good luck!
 RT  Congrats to the best manager the Red Sox have ever had for earning win No. 1,000. And no, that doesn't mean you, Joe  ...
 Dear Lord this day need a drunk group sing/dance to Like A Prayer. 
 Currently using the Scarlett O'Hara coping mechanism. I'll think about it tomorrow. I literally have to go to a ball tonight anyway.
 Well my day just went to complete and total shit. :( I need a hug.
 RT  Congarts to Cadel to you deserve that! Happy for you and your team BMC!its been a great battle looking forward to next ...
 Well, I can't fault that ride, so disappointed for Andy Schleck, but congrats to Cadel Evans!
 Ok, on a serious note, very sad day in Norway today, thoughts are with them.
 Oh, that's why I don't like Cadel Evans, he's whiny and always looks like he's about to burst into tears.
 Awesome to see Andy Schleck in yellow on the podium. Kiss that lion dude, you earned it. Getcha 2 more please.
 Andy Schleck is going to have to time trial his legs off tomorrow, but he has the maillot jaune tonight, it's doable Andy, one more day!
 Atta boy Pierre Roland congrats on winning the Alpe d'Huez Stage! Glad Contador isn't getting the win today.
 Cadel tries to go, finally, and Andy marks him easily.
 Suddenly rooting hard for Pierre Rolland.
  yup, a long time ago
 The d'Huez crowd is insane today.
 Contador just punched a fan running along side him, If I were that fan I'd have kicked his bike over.
 I hate Alberto Contador, but he's having a beautiful climb up d'Huez today.
 Come on Andy, go, go, go!
 Red Sox win!
 Asterix has been dropped, no shame Tommy Voeckler, you've made France proud.
 Contador is flying up the hill, Andy and Cadel just marking each other, I'd feel better if they were chasing Contador a little more urgently
 Asterix is still tracking the Schleckis. The man is tenacious to say the least.
 Here we go, it's gonna get CRAZY on d'Huez!
  Glad I've converted a new fan! The only thing I love more than the Tour is October baseball when the Red Sox are doing well.
 Ok Andy, time to Give It All You've Got, Part Deux. (ps. save a a little something because this is a trilogy with the TT tomorrow)
  Absolutely, can't imagine being one of the camera guys riding backwards down the Alps on the scooters though, insane!
 My fave part of the TDF, besides epic bicycle racing, is always the scenery, France is a gorgeous backdrop for the best race in the world.
 Something about Cadel Evans just annoys me.
 Andy in yellow and polka dots at the end of the day? I could be happy with that...
 Alpe D'Huez time! I banned myself from Twitter and the internets and have no clue what went down today, looking forward to watching le TDF!
 So excited/nervous for Team Schleck on Alpe d'Huez today. Pedal hard boys.
 Eat well and sleep well, Schleckis, another trip up Galibier tomorrow before Alpe d'Huez. I cannot wait to see it.
  I'm so stressed for Andy tomorrow now. Best TDF in a long time!
  I really want to see Voeckler on the podium. I'm starting to have Dustin Pedroia-esque affection for him.
 Asterix, pour le gloire de France!
 Atta boy Frankie, Frank Schleck coming home 2nd.
 Wow. Congrats on a magnificent stage win 
 Seriously though, giddy up Andy, go buddy, go!
 Asterix has the heart of a champion. You go Tommy Voeckler, you go.
 Wow, any time you have Eddie Merckx cheering you on out of a sunroof in the TDF you know you're doing something right.
 Oh, beautiful, wish you were here! Yodelayhehoo! 
 Look at Asterix! Right there behind Evans in the main pack, come on Voeckler, get on that podium!
 Come on Andy!
 So nervous/excited for Andy Schleck.
 Cadel Evans is such an uninspiring competitor. Alberto Contador is a total douche but at least he has style.
 Anyone else hoping Tommy Voeckler busts out of the group and guns it up the mountain? Would love him to be on the podium on Sunday.
 RT  SCLLLEEECCKKKSSSS!
  91 here, I just checked.
 Looks like Andy Schleck put on the big boy legs so far today. Loving it.
 These people on the road to the summit of Izoard have sweaters and gloves on. I'm in a tank top and shorts and sweating. Crazy world.
 RT  Breaking News: The NFL is about as close to having a deal made than I am to having a date with Wes Welker.
  yup, we're on the Izoard. I saw this bit at lunch, he was descending when I went back up to the barn.
 Paul Sherwin: Wow, what is that? That is the Schleck Express...
 Go Andy, go!!!
  I pretty much know what happens, I saw a good chunk earlier, GREAT stage and riding, classic TDF stuff.
 Counting the seconds until TDF coverage starts. Dying to see today's finish. Haven't seen spoilers, but got a tantalizing glimpse at lunch.
 I think it's officially hot as balls out. (Not complaining, more an astute meteorological observation)
 GLUED to Noon TDF coverage. It's definitely balls out strategy day.
 RT   In the last 20 years, only Indurain Armstrong and Cancellara have led the Tour for longer than Thomas Voeckler ...
 Counting the seconds until I can go home and watch the TDF!
  That's awesome!
  I think everybody has been there, no drama at the moment for me :)
 Went on a hilly trail run today. It would seem cranky knee is not so pleased by this development.
  been there.
 TDF Prime Time. It's going to kill me waiting to see d'Izoard and Galibier tomorrow.
 RT  Win a trip to Paris (or Africa), change 1000 people’s lives with  and me. Grand Slam for Zambia! . ...
  Up 2-0 in the 5th :)
 Lounging on my bed, listening to the Red Sox and eating peanut M&Ms with unabashed enjoyment. I might even doze through the middle innings.
 There are some fantastic tan lines being sported by the boys on the podium and all over the peloton. 
 Wow. It's going to be a crazy couple of days through the Alps, can't wait for the Galibier finish tomorrow.
 The Schlecks descend well and finish with Contador today. Good on ya boys. Asterix had an adventurous descent, but keeps the yellow.
 Thomas Voeckler is Asterix on a bicycle.
 RT  I take it back: this descent is NUTS. Carparks, riders off the road. Sort of dangerous...  
 Congrats to Edvald Boasson Hagen on today's stage win! Norway 4, France 0.
 Tommy Voeckler is still hanging with the big boys. France can be more than proud of their maillot jaune.
 Edvald BoassonHagen going for the break-away win, no God of Thunder in his rear view so I'm optimistic he can hang on...
 Andy Schleck needs to nut up or shut up today.
 Contador attacking with Schleck and Voeckler on his back wheel.
 2 Norewegian riders, 3 stage victories. 45 French riders, 0 victories. Ouch.
 Looks like fireworks are about to begin over the last climb of the day. Andy Schleck needs to redeem himself or ride for Frank.
 Interesting watching Vaughters and Bruyneel have a strategic chat while rolling along in the team cars.
 RT  More photos added from  win w/  ; we esp. like this one:  
 Amazing scenery today and for the next few days in the Alps.
 Tour de France time! Spoilers to follow...
  haha, me too, Voeckler is riding his guts out.
  Also, how does Andy not have to ride for Frank now? Frank has been a bawse. I might have to switch my Schleck allegiance.
  It was one very bad day, le Tour will do that to you. Contador is still behind Andy in the GC and still a total doucheketeer.
  I'm not ready to pull the plug on him, everybody says stupid stuff in the interview right after the race, but def a black mark.
 Thor Hushovd is the man.
 Also, Dave Zabriskie is awesome. 
 This, by the way, is how Thor and the Argyle Armada presented themselves to the Tour this year. 
 Love that you can see Thor's name on the tupperware on the dashboard, like his mom packed his lunch or something 
 So the robot has a blog... Jens Voigt writes for bicycling.com. Good stuff.
 Re-watching today's TDF stage, because that's how much I love Thor Hushovd.
  Done!
 RT  We'll never get tired of this:  SMASH!!!  
  We should definitely get together and catch up!
 Dear Roommates who are not Dutch Roomie: My laundry detergent is not your laundry detergent.
  Also, Red Bull rampage is sick.
  If you wait 40 minutes le Tour will be on again. And again at 2:30, maybe at 5, and again at 8. All Tour all the time...
 Just realized a week from today I'll already be on Martha's Vineyard for all of August. Super excited.
 So does Andy ride for Frank now? Seems like it has to be that way.
 Schlecks losing tons of time today. :(
  This has been the best TDF in years though, loving all the action and battles.
  I'm hopelessly hoping the Schlecks are trying to save energy or something here, but as long as Contador doesn't win I'm happy.
  Tour de France, Thor Hushovd just won another stage in style.
 Cannot overstate how much I love Thor Hushovd owning this Tour de France.
 The God of Thunder hammers out another stage win, congrats to Thor Hushovd on winning TDF Stage 16.
 THOR FUCKING HUSHOVD.
 Ugh. I don't really want to pull for Cadel Evans the rest of the way, but I will if I have to. Feeling annoyed w/ Andy Schleck today.
 How do you not start to root for Tommy Voeckler? Dude is riding like a champion.
 Interesting games going on up this category 2 climb, Contador tried to attack but is reeled in by the Schlecks, Evans and Voeckler.
 RT  Following the peloton answering the call of nature en mass, the escapees now have slightly over 2 minutes on the pack
 Going to be interesting how this stage plays out. Uphill finish, maybe the God of Thunder can get clear again and rumble home for the win...
 Morning y'all, it's TDF time! I will be posting spoilers this AM.
  This whole game has been a hot mess.
 Just realized in the Oriole trash talk kerfuffle of last week I didn't hear one Angry Birds joke.
 Well shit Timmy. 
  haha, more like smart mouth punk who isn't afraid of the F-bomb and doesn't know when to quit.
  I think the original Laser Show can keep his spot at second, I throw like Chuck Knoblauch.
 Just took the Globe's which Red Sox player are you quiz... I'm Dustin Pedroia, sounds about right I guess.
 I kinda wish the cartoon Nerds on the candy boxes were real things. They look like they'd be fun little pets.
 RT  The roads of France need the rest day to recover from  
 Currently regretting staying up with the Red Sox.
 RED SOX WIN!!! Night y'all.
 Joe Castiglione still sounds fresh as a daisy.
 LASER SHOW! Red Sox take the lead!
 This game is nuts.
  I'd bring a few, I didn't cry, but there were a few parts where I considered it. Loved the movie, they did a great job.
 Josh Reddick a bawse.
 Ugh. I hate when "oh I'll just see how the Sox did" turns into sleep deprivation.
 Daniel Bard if you lose this game here your record will be 1-5. That's not pretty.
 Congrats to Mark Cavendish on the Stage 15 win, though really I wish Tyler Farrar had won too.
 Wow, apparently I've missed quite a game, I'm here now, Red Sox, you can go ahead and win now.
 Harry Potter was awesome!
  True story, I've had 2 Cosmos, I'm slightly tipsy. Happy, if you will.
 Slightly tipsy and headed to Harry Potter! Yay!
 The only thing sustaining me right now is that at the end of the day I get several cosmopolitans and Harry Potter.
 Wow, what a climb. Les Alpes are going to be an epic battle. Congrats to Jelle Vanendert on the stage win.
 Jens Voight is leading the pack up Plateau de Beille. He's bleeding from his 2 crashes so he may not be a robot after all, just BAD ASS.
 Ok Schlecks, giddy up...
 Oh no! Jensie hit the pavement this time. Bad day for the robot.
 Oh man, Jensie Voight went flying into the bushes, lucky landing there.
  I don't know, but he planted his face into the ground... yeeeowch.
  The guy on RaboBank who broke his nose.
 Just audibly went "ow" at that crash.
  Oh I am :) I think I actually enjoyed watching yesterday's stage more because I knew Thor had such an amazing ride going in.
  I think he'll be back sometime in August.
  I think we all want DiceK's money back. I don't not like Crawford, but we had cheaper talent in our own backyard.
 Aaaaand 11 minutes into TDF prime time coverage I just saw a minor spoiler. There goes a whole days work.
  Dude, those of us watching prime time coverage won't know that for 2.5 hours or so, horrible timing with the spoiler.
 Tour de France, Plateau de Beille time!
  I really wish we hadn't thrown all that money at Carl Crawford when we have Reddick and Kalish coming up.
 Red Sox win! And Joe Castiglione had an Obi Wan moment "that's not a laser show... it's a power surge..."
 RT  In 62 at-bats, Reddick has three homers and 17 RBIs. In 220 at-bats, J.D. Drew has four homers and 21 RBIs.
 Does somebody maybe wanna go check out Scutaro?
 Long day. Grocery store, running, then TDF time! I even managed to avoid spoilers so far today! Which means I'll fall asleep at like 8:42.
 GOD OF THUNDER! Amazing ride for Thor Hushovd today, huge congratulations on the TDF Stage 13 win!
  Or Marshall Mathers Motors... Emineminem
  I love my lobster, and my ice cream, but that sounds gross.
 Thor Hushovd  is a beast. BEAST.
 There is going to be an Olympic Curling/Hockey-esque hole in my life when this year's TDF is over, one for the ages so far.
 Tour de France!!! On a down not, poor Levi Leipheimer looks depressed, Team Radioshack is one hurting unit.
 Running, tucking in the ponies, and then will be glued to what promises to be an EPIC watching of le Tour de France Stage 13.
 Cannot wait to watch Le Thor this evening... Can. Not. Wait.
 Look at what Dutch Roomie got me!  
 Ugh. The beginning of 495 South is a parking lot.
 Headed back to NY. Lovely time in Maine, bummed I can't stay for the Sea Dogs game tonight.
 Maine People: Port Bean in Portland has excellent Whoopie Pies. A+. Good sandwiches too.
 RT  One Schleck, two Schleck. Red Schleck, blue Schleck. 
 Joyeux Jour de la Bastille a mes amis francais!
 Another stage, another loss for Contador. 
  I think he could have, but better to let Sanchez get the stage win, he did all the hard work, good etiquette for Frank Schleck.
 Contador lost 13 seconds to Andy Schleck and Evans and 33 to Frank Schleck, who suddenly looks like he could have ambitions of his own.
 Frank Schleck is now in second overall.
 Contador is finishing by himself, looks like he's hurting, lost 10-15 seconds, by my estimation, to Andy and Cadel. Voeckler keeping yellow.
 Congrats to Sammy Sanchez on the stage win! Frank Schleck coming in 3rd, Andy and Evans have dropped Contador!
 Frank Schleck is flying up the mountain right now.
 Frank Schleck has gone off the front, Andy, Contador, and Evans haven't gone with him so far.
 Frank Schleck looks great today.
 Andy is starting the cat and mouse games. Frank is playing too, Contador and Evans in the mix. Go Team Schleck!
 Nice to see Levi Leipheimer up in the main group too, be nice to see him get a stage win somewhere this year.
 Phil and Paul are a tad concerned about Andy Schleck. He's still in the main pack w/ Contador and Evans.
 Bought an  Tervis travel mug yesterday, put coffee in at 9:30 and it's still warm. Retiring my still working 10 year old LL Bean mug.

 Seriously, Jens Voight is a robot.
 Terrifying looking descent off the Tourmalet, be careful boys.
 I'd like to see Johan Bruyneel in charge of Leopard Trek and Andy Schleck at some point in the future.
 Terrible timing but he's back going, hopefully that's his bad luck for this year done and over with.
 Andy Schleck has punctured a front wheel and quickly changed in 10 seconds...
 I think Jens Voight is a robot. He's leading the charge of the peloton up the hill and making it look easy.
 Klodi is a gamer, still in the peloton and cruising up Tourmalet after another crash earlier today.

 Well this year's Vuelta slogan totally just ripped off a great Lance Armstrong quote.
 Tour de France time! So incredibly excited for Tourmalet and Luz-Ardiden tomorrow. And today's sprint finish, of course.
 Just saw a bumper sticker for Dook Fencing. I'm guessing those parents were proud of their honor student at one point too.

 I love Maine! ( L.L.Bean Flagship Store) 
  No, she's not a little dog, she's just not my type personality wise.
 Heading up to Freeport for some shopping with Mom! And lobstah bisque at the Lobstah Cookah, best in Maine.
  Oh this dog has been around for a few years, she's just not my type of dog.
  Yeah, I just feel bad about it because I don't really like the new dog.
  Yeah, I just feel kinda bad because I don't really like the new dog.
 Just called my Mom's current dog by our old dog's name. In my defense they look a lot alike and I have never lived with the current pooch.
 Also Thor Hushovd with another top 10 finish. Tour de Thor?
 Congrats to Andre Greipel for getting the stage win today.
 Bummed Cavandish didn't get the win today.
  I've actually gotten on I87 at the border but was headed south after a misguided, tho pretty, detour through Lake Champlain
 I'm so going to le Tour one year. The whole thing. And I'm going drink wine and eat cheese and do a lot of hungover cycling.
  me too!
 Parents, its good to see you and all, but your wireless connection sucks.
  I love my Red Sox. And I live about 1.5 hours north of NYC.
 Thor Hushovd is currently riding in his socks. (watching more TDF than All-Star game)

 Riding ponies all day and then headed to Maine tonight! Hope I get there in time to see some of Stage 10 and maybe a little All-Star action.
 People in this bar are chanting "Asshole" at Big Papi on the TV. You stay classy New York.
 This might make me a snob, but I totally judge people on their etiquette. A fork is not shovel, hold it appropriately.

  Good to know!
  I just know it'll be my luck that I'll use my upgrade and then next week they'll get a really cool new model or something.
  I really want a Bberry Torch, but Sprint doesn't carry them and I'm not switching providers, so prolly another Curve.
 Yeeeowch! Maybe NSFW RT  Johnny Hoogerland gets our Courage Award - hit by a car & lands on a barb wired fence?? 
 Nice and toasty warm today, I love this weather. The ponies are all camped out under their fans, I bet they're happy it's Monday.
  I am kind of excited for a new phone, but I've had this Blackberry for 2 years and I love it. Sad day.
 Have woken to a sad truth: When I knocked my Blackberry off the nightstand last night I cracked the screen. :(
 Dear Versus: Please, please put Craig Hummer back on the desk.
 You go Johnny Hoogerland! Way to finish! Chicks dig scars. Also, I want one of those King of the Mountain trophy girl dresses.
  Phil and Paul mulled it over, but no conclusive evidence shown so far... I prefer to think he just made a bonehead mistake.
  I have no idea, but if they don't they should make an exception in this case!
 Congrats to Luis-Leon Sanchez on the stage win today, sad to see Thor lose the maillot jaune, but he made it a great 1st week of the Tour.
  is hopefully in the unemployment line.
  I'm just glad he's toughing this stage out, that would be a terrible way to have to abandon!
  It might have helped more that hurt, more give on the landing than hard ground, but I hope he's up to date on his tetanus shot!
 Poor Johnny Hoogerland. Hope he can finish the day.
  They're my go to quick and easy snack/meal!
 Contador has eaten some asphalt today too. All on his own. Because he bounced off another rider. 
  If they reel in the breakaway here, Thor keeps the maillot jaune...
 Ok, so it was Hoogerland who went airborn, not Fletcher, thought both hit the deck spectacularly hard after being taken out by a tv car.
 Come on Hoogerland, get back on the bike and get your polka dot jersey!
 As Phil Liggett put it: Disgraceful.
 HOLY SHIT. They're getting taken out by tv cars now. Fletcher goes flying through the air and lands on a barb wire fence, he's ok though.
 OH. MY. GOD. I outweigh Alberto Contador by 3 pounds.
 Love all of Thor's lions on the front of the Garmin Cervelo bus.
 Sort of hoping Thor Hushovd somehow, miraculously, holds on to the yellow jersey again...

 I really wish I had a Trader Joes here.
  I never had a problem with them either, loved Cal Jr and the 90s team, always sort of felt like we were partners against NYY.
 Just getting caught up on last night's Red Sox game. Who new the Orioles were such little bitches?
 Dear New York: I'm so completely done with this shit.
 Probably not going to get to watch much, if any, of le Tour this evening. :( So I cheated and read recaps... won't spoil, but YIKES.

 Thor still in yellow, but poor Levi Leipheimer has lost about a minute after a late crash.
 Leipheimer just went down, back on and pedaling, but he's going to have to hustle to get back to the peloton.
 What's that Phil and Paul? Saxo Bank doesn't seem all that enthused about protecting Contador? Couldn't imagine why...
  it's actually not that bad if the horses are clean, and show horses usually are, but wet barnyards are always a bit smelly
 I'd imagine a bike race in the rain is just as miserable as a horse show in the rain, possibly with less mud and prolly no wet horse smell.
 If nothing else Contador is having to use lots of extra energy in all these flat stage shenanigans. 
 Contador having bike issues today, currently at the back of the field...
 OMG! People! on the grounds of a chateau!
 If I had property like that, a. there would be horses and b. you would be able to tell I lived there by the Red Sox logo cut into the lawn
 Why does it always look like the chateaux shown during TDF coverage are abandoned? No car in the driveway, just immaculate emptiness.
 Looks like Mark Cavendish wants a green jersey...
 I will be posting TDF spoilers again this morning...
 Red Sox win! for those of you keeping score at home that's win number 198 and 184 for Tim Wakefield. (get out of my brain Joe Castiglione!)
 This Red Sox game has featured a 1/2 hour-ish rain delay and still, so far, is under 3 hours. Tim Wakefield, I salute you & your efficiency.
 Boo  
 Jaysus H. Roosevelt Keerist... why are we talking about Brett Favre in any other role besides possibly commentating or HOF balloting?
  Agree, but beg to differ. Anyone ever daring to wave a rally or wtf-ever towel at Fenway gets their head on a stake on the Monstah.
  Was thinking mostly of Monday and the almost comeback and the 4th of July hat.
 Past decade or so only. They seem to be a better team when not wearing Hanging Sox abominations or holiday gear.
 I would like to see a study on the Red Sox win/loss percentage when they wear the classic navy/red B hat as opposed to other designs.
 Ellsbury is a full on stud tonight.
 All strike outs for Wakefield coming on the knuckleball... Really Remy? In other news, the Green Monster is green.
 JD Drew, still not worth $14/year, but nice catch there.
 YOOOOUUUK!
 Atta boy Ellsbury!
  It all ended well, great finishing sprint today!
 Lovely dinner with BFF and now home in time to see Wake. Settle in Timmy. Grip, kick, and throw, bud.
  Don't think I don't know what you're doing there.
 New favorite song to run downhill to: She's Country, Jason Aldean. Also, I miss my truck.
 Timmy Wake on the hill for the Red Sox tonight. I don't think it's possible to overstate my love for the man.
 One question, where the hell was Tyler Farrar today? Not up in the sprint at all...
 Today's Tour de France stage summed up: Carnage in Brittany and an exciting finish.
 What a finish! Great win for Cav!
  Didn't say I wanted that to happen, but the way today has gone... Crashes breed more crashes.
  haha, oh, I know my Nascar, just not as into it these days. I used to watch races on TNN. :)
 Wondering if the peloton is going to have a "Big One" (to borrow a nascar term) on the run in to the finish. Seems like that kind of day.
 I'm likely to get around to the mani/pedi, but everything else not so much. Like money? Like to vacuum? Come to my house.
 That could have been an awesome embarrassing ringtone moment.
 Things I should be doing today but I'm not because I'm watching le Tour: laundry, cleaning my house, oil change/car inspection, mani/pedi...
 I'm usually a Trek kind of girl, but that Cannondale Evo is hawt.
 Phil and Paul are getting a bit chippy.
  Best part is he had an extension, plus cell phone. I used to tell him his mom was calling over the intercom so everyone could hear
  When I worked in an office we had a guy whose mom would call the main office line at least once a week.
 Boonen literally gritting his teeth and back on the bike.
 Another crash, Tom Boonen and most of Quick Step just hit the pavement. Boonen is still down.
 Le Tour is taking no prisoners today. Popovych ate it at some point too. Still pedaling along though.
  I've actually seriously looked into going, there are some awesome bike tours out there.
 Wow, another nasty crash, only Nicki Sorensen involved, but safe to say there is some road rash happening there.
 Enjoying watching Contador fail with the glee usually reserved for A-Rod or Kobe. 
 It's not bad luck for Contador, Phil and Paul, it's karma. 
 Brajkovic is bandaged up and being carted off in an ambulance. Poor guy.
 Contador is back on a new bike and headed on his way back to the peloton. The back of his jersey is a little shredded. 
 Contador is down! Contador is down!
 Oh wow, new crash, Jani Brajkovic went down *hard.* He's up and moving, but looks pretty hurt.
 Brittany looks a lot like Maine.
 Nope, same crash, just now we know Leipheimer was delayed in it too.
 Twitter is telling me there is a second crash... Versus is on commercial...
 And we have the first crash of the day. Wiggins and Chavanel involved. Plenty of time to get back to the peloton. Very narrow roads today.
 I say this every year, but some summer I am going to go and follow le Tour around France.
 I hope Cav or Tyler win today. Or Thor, because Thor deserves a nice win after yesterday's ride. Long way to go today though.
 Yes, lets ask Mark Cavendish why he isn't winning stages and piss him off, that worked out well for everyone last year...
 Coffee, toast and le Tour! I will be posting spoilers this morning.
 Ok y'all, I will be posting TDF spoilers tomorrow morning, you've been warned.
 Alberto Contador went deep? I highly doubt that's what she said. 
 Alberto Contador still at 1:42 behind in the overall, can't wait to get up tomorrow and watch him fail some more.
 Quite happy The God of Thunder is still in yellow. Thor Hushovd has always been one of my favorites. Argyle is sexy.
  I had an inkling it was Evans anyway, saw half a spoiler earlier today, but Contador is still way far behind so we all win!
 Congrats to Cadel Evans, suck it Contador, and hats off to Thor Hushovd.
 Thor Hushovd is going balls out today. Love it.
  not done yet... but in the same group most likely
 I don't particularly care about Cadel Evans, but I love seeing George Hincapie still showing everyone how it's done.
 Well that was more exciting than it needed to be, but Red Sox win!
 RT  Lester left the game due to a left lat strain. 
 RT  Gotta love  skipper Clint Hurdle when asked if team scoreboard watches. "Some of our guys don't even realize we hav ...
 I agree with Phil Liggett, Thor/Cav intermediate sprint elimination yesterday was total bullshit. (Phil was more eloquent in his statement)
  I took your advice and went to the store :)
 Wow, Jon Lester must really be sick if they pulled him in the middle of a no-hitter.
 In all my TDF giddiness I've been neglecting the Red Sox, though of course I've been keeping tabs on them, hope Lester is ok...
 On my tv? 198 insanely fit men biking across France. Me? Sitting in an armchair eating pretzels and drinking beer. Slight disconnect.
 Putting way too much thought into whether or not I want to go to the grocery store.
  haha, seriously. I'm actually excited that I can get up early on my day off tomorrow and watch the live coverage!
 Just off the phone with Anthropologie customer service, getting a sale price adjusted in my favor, they could not have been more helpful!
 Really want to dig in to online TDF coverage and twitter and whatnot, can't decide if I want to see spoilers... I get to watch live tomorrow
 Noon TDF coverage, natch.
 I'm putting my TDF money on Cancellara today.
 Jonathan Vaughters really needs to rethink those sideburns.
 Really? I hadn't noticed... RT  Red Sox Are Streakiest Team in Baseball, According to Study 
 HUGE congrats to Tyler Farrar on his first Tour de France stage win! Nice to see an American win on July 4, couldn't happen to a nicer dude.
  I want Craig back at the desk, Liam is annoying as fuck and the only annoying desk person I will tolerate is Bob Roll.
  That was some serious effort for 30 seconds of TV time, mad props to them!
 I don't like the new Versus TDF desk guy, bring back Craig Hummer!
 Ok, the farmers who put together the tractor bike totally rock. 
 Also, this little gem  was brought to my attention by  
 Lunch time with the TDF, accidentally already saw today's result, and VERY excited to watch as much as possible now.
 RT  Figuring out tactics for the stage today..... only one option: WIN.
 So far this Tour de France is going swimmingly. My faves are doing well and Contador is in trouble. Couldn't have asked for a better start.
  Rubiera?
 Red Sox win!
  Joe Castiglione and Jerry Trupiano will always be the voices of the Red Sox for me.
 Anyone wish Jerry Trupiano was calling that Pedroia almost home run? I still miss Trup, if nothing else, he was enthusiastic.
  STFU. Sweet Carolin is FUN.
 Damn. So close, Pedroia, so close.
 I will always love Jason Varitek.
  Superman wears Dustin Pedroia pajamas.
 I think Dustin Pedroia likes hitting cleanup.
  Karma then.
 Pretty slide there Ells.
  popular sentiment...
 So I hate CC as much as the next person, but I think trying to jinx an enemy's no-no is bad juju for the next time your guy has one going...
  haha, thanks.
 If you don't love Dustin Pedroia you're either a Yankee fan, a dumbass, or a dumbass Yankee fan.
 Raise your hand if you miss Clay Buchholz.
 Things I didn't really expect to see this year: David Ortiz hitting .300 Rock on Big Papi.
 Red Sox on NESN on my TeeVee. 
  I even found a new trail to go out on tomorrow! Yeah biking, indeed!
 Seriously MV, Do you have a fatwah against CapeCod BBQ Chips? Suddenly remember last summer when I couldn't find them anywhere... 
 Best part about MV? (And there are lots) The state preservation park thing in my backyard... I'm going biking!
 Have I mentioned how much I love Martha's Vineyard? Because I love it so much I'd marry it. And then I'd have an affair with the house here.
 Murgh. I miss Dutch Roomie :( Also today I learned that Popeye the Sailor Man is called Alfred in Sweden. WTF?
 On Martha's Vineyard! Lovely to be back in a NESN state for awhile.
 RT  Anyone else with an extra amount of time on there hands right about now?  
 I just ousted  as the mayor of Bangall Whaling Co. on  
 Leaving for a month on Martha's Vineyard tomorrow! But first, a very sad, very unplanned and very tear filled goodbye to Dutch Roomie. :(
 Win number 199 and 185 for Tim Wakefield! Just keep pitching, just keep pitching, just keep pitching...
 Well, now that I'm not obsessed with a bunch of guys biking around France I can get back to obsessing over the Red Sox. Happy 2000 Ks Wake!
 So bummed the Tour de France ends today.
 Dear Coworker: If you're going to come to work hungover as fuck don't spend the whole morning brag-whining about it. No one cares.
 RT  ON THIS DAY: In 2005 Lance Armstrong wins a record 7th Tour de France and retires from cycling
  Good luck!
 RT  Congrats to the best manager the Red Sox have ever had for earning win No. 1,000. And no, that doesn't mean you, Joe  ...
 Dear Lord this day need a drunk group sing/dance to Like A Prayer. 
 Currently using the Scarlett O'Hara coping mechanism. I'll think about it tomorrow. I literally have to go to a ball tonight anyway.
 Well my day just went to complete and total shit. :( I need a hug.
 RT  Congarts to Cadel to you deserve that! Happy for you and your team BMC!its been a great battle looking forward to next ...
 Well, I can't fault that ride, so disappointed for Andy Schleck, but congrats to Cadel Evans!
 Ok, on a serious note, very sad day in Norway today, thoughts are with them.
 Oh, that's why I don't like Cadel Evans, he's whiny and always looks like he's about to burst into tears.
 Awesome to see Andy Schleck in yellow on the podium. Kiss that lion dude, you earned it. Getcha 2 more please.
 Andy Schleck is going to have to time trial his legs off tomorrow, but he has the maillot jaune tonight, it's doable Andy, one more day!
 Atta boy Pierre Roland congrats on winning the Alpe d'Huez Stage! Glad Contador isn't getting the win today.
 Cadel tries to go, finally, and Andy marks him easily.
 Suddenly rooting hard for Pierre Rolland.
  yup, a long time ago
 The d'Huez crowd is insane today.
 Contador just punched a fan running along side him, If I were that fan I'd have kicked his bike over.
 I hate Alberto Contador, but he's having a beautiful climb up d'Huez today.
 Come on Andy, go, go, go!
 Red Sox win!
 Asterix has been dropped, no shame Tommy Voeckler, you've made France proud.
 Contador is flying up the hill, Andy and Cadel just marking each other, I'd feel better if they were chasing Contador a little more urgently
 Asterix is still tracking the Schleckis. The man is tenacious to say the least.
 Here we go, it's gonna get CRAZY on d'Huez!
  Glad I've converted a new fan! The only thing I love more than the Tour is October baseball when the Red Sox are doing well.
 Ok Andy, time to Give It All You've Got, Part Deux. (ps. save a a little something because this is a trilogy with the TT tomorrow)
  Absolutely, can't imagine being one of the camera guys riding backwards down the Alps on the scooters though, insane!
 My fave part of the TDF, besides epic bicycle racing, is always the scenery, France is a gorgeous backdrop for the best race in the world.
 Something about Cadel Evans just annoys me.
 Andy in yellow and polka dots at the end of the day? I could be happy with that...
 Alpe D'Huez time! I banned myself from Twitter and the internets and have no clue what went down today, looking forward to watching le TDF!
 So excited/nervous for Team Schleck on Alpe d'Huez today. Pedal hard boys.
 Eat well and sleep well, Schleckis, another trip up Galibier tomorrow before Alpe d'Huez. I cannot wait to see it.
  I'm so stressed for Andy tomorrow now. Best TDF in a long time!
  I really want to see Voeckler on the podium. I'm starting to have Dustin Pedroia-esque affection for him.
 Asterix, pour le gloire de France!
 Atta boy Frankie, Frank Schleck coming home 2nd.
 Wow. Congrats on a magnificent stage win 
 Seriously though, giddy up Andy, go buddy, go!
 Asterix has the heart of a champion. You go Tommy Voeckler, you go.
 Wow, any time you have Eddie Merckx cheering you on out of a sunroof in the TDF you know you're doing something right.
 Oh, beautiful, wish you were here! Yodelayhehoo! 
 Look at Asterix! Right there behind Evans in the main pack, come on Voeckler, get on that podium!
 Come on Andy!
 So nervous/excited for Andy Schleck.
 Cadel Evans is such an uninspiring competitor. Alberto Contador is a total douche but at least he has style.
 Anyone else hoping Tommy Voeckler busts out of the group and guns it up the mountain? Would love him to be on the podium on Sunday.
 RT  SCLLLEEECCKKKSSSS!
  91 here, I just checked.
 Looks like Andy Schleck put on the big boy legs so far today. Loving it.
 These people on the road to the summit of Izoard have sweaters and gloves on. I'm in a tank top and shorts and sweating. Crazy world.
 RT  Breaking News: The NFL is about as close to having a deal made than I am to having a date with Wes Welker.
  yup, we're on the Izoard. I saw this bit at lunch, he was descending when I went back up to the barn.
 Paul Sherwin: Wow, what is that? That is the Schleck Express...
 Go Andy, go!!!
  I pretty much know what happens, I saw a good chunk earlier, GREAT stage and riding, classic TDF stuff.
 Counting the seconds until TDF coverage starts. Dying to see today's finish. Haven't seen spoilers, but got a tantalizing glimpse at lunch.
 I think it's officially hot as balls out. (Not complaining, more an astute meteorological observation)
 GLUED to Noon TDF coverage. It's definitely balls out strategy day.
 RT   In the last 20 years, only Indurain Armstrong and Cancellara have led the Tour for longer than Thomas Voeckler ...
 Counting the seconds until I can go home and watch the TDF!
  That's awesome!
  I think everybody has been there, no drama at the moment for me :)
 Went on a hilly trail run today. It would seem cranky knee is not so pleased by this development.
  been there.
 TDF Prime Time. It's going to kill me waiting to see d'Izoard and Galibier tomorrow.
 RT  Win a trip to Paris (or Africa), change 1000 people’s lives with  and me. Grand Slam for Zambia! . ...
  Up 2-0 in the 5th :)
 Lounging on my bed, listening to the Red Sox and eating peanut M&Ms with unabashed enjoyment. I might even doze through the middle innings.
 There are some fantastic tan lines being sported by the boys on the podium and all over the peloton. 
 Wow. It's going to be a crazy couple of days through the Alps, can't wait for the Galibier finish tomorrow.
 The Schlecks descend well and finish with Contador today. Good on ya boys. Asterix had an adventurous descent, but keeps the yellow.
 Thomas Voeckler is Asterix on a bicycle.
 RT  I take it back: this descent is NUTS. Carparks, riders off the road. Sort of dangerous...  
 Congrats to Edvald Boasson Hagen on today's stage win! Norway 4, France 0.
 Tommy Voeckler is still hanging with the big boys. France can be more than proud of their maillot jaune.
 Edvald BoassonHagen going for the break-away win, no God of Thunder in his rear view so I'm optimistic he can hang on...
 Andy Schleck needs to nut up or shut up today.
 Contador attacking with Schleck and Voeckler on his back wheel.
 2 Norewegian riders, 3 stage victories. 45 French riders, 0 victories. Ouch.
 Looks like fireworks are about to begin over the last climb of the day. Andy Schleck needs to redeem himself or ride for Frank.
 Interesting watching Vaughters and Bruyneel have a strategic chat while rolling along in the team cars.
 RT  More photos added from  win w/  ; we esp. like this one:  
 Amazing scenery today and for the next few days in the Alps.
 Tour de France time! Spoilers to follow...
  haha, me too, Voeckler is riding his guts out.
  Also, how does Andy not have to ride for Frank now? Frank has been a bawse. I might have to switch my Schleck allegiance.
  It was one very bad day, le Tour will do that to you. Contador is still behind Andy in the GC and still a total doucheketeer.
  I'm not ready to pull the plug on him, everybody says stupid stuff in the interview right after the race, but def a black mark.
 Thor Hushovd is the man.
 Also, Dave Zabriskie is awesome. 
 This, by the way, is how Thor and the Argyle Armada presented themselves to the Tour this year. 
 Love that you can see Thor's name on the tupperware on the dashboard, like his mom packed his lunch or something 
 So the robot has a blog... Jens Voigt writes for bicycling.com. Good stuff.
 Re-watching today's TDF stage, because that's how much I love Thor Hushovd.
  Done!
 RT  We'll never get tired of this:  SMASH!!!  
  We should definitely get together and catch up!
 Dear Roommates who are not Dutch Roomie: My laundry detergent is not your laundry detergent.
  Also, Red Bull rampage is sick.
  If you wait 40 minutes le Tour will be on again. And again at 2:30, maybe at 5, and again at 8. All Tour all the time...
 Just realized a week from today I'll already be on Martha's Vineyard for all of August. Super excited.
 So does Andy ride for Frank now? Seems like it has to be that way.
 Schlecks losing tons of time today. :(
  This has been the best TDF in years though, loving all the action and battles.
  I'm hopelessly hoping the Schlecks are trying to save energy or something here, but as long as Contador doesn't win I'm happy.
  Tour de France, Thor Hushovd just won another stage in style.
 Cannot overstate how much I love Thor Hushovd owning this Tour de France.
 The God of Thunder hammers out another stage win, congrats to Thor Hushovd on winning TDF Stage 16.
 THOR FUCKING HUSHOVD.
 Ugh. I don't really want to pull for Cadel Evans the rest of the way, but I will if I have to. Feeling annoyed w/ Andy Schleck today.
 How do you not start to root for Tommy Voeckler? Dude is riding like a champion.
 Interesting games going on up this category 2 climb, Contador tried to attack but is reeled in by the Schlecks, Evans and Voeckler.
 RT  Following the peloton answering the call of nature en mass, the escapees now have slightly over 2 minutes on the pack
 Going to be interesting how this stage plays out. Uphill finish, maybe the God of Thunder can get clear again and rumble home for the win...
 Morning y'all, it's TDF time! I will be posting spoilers this AM.
  This whole game has been a hot mess.
 Just realized in the Oriole trash talk kerfuffle of last week I didn't hear one Angry Birds joke.
 Well shit Timmy. 
  haha, more like smart mouth punk who isn't afraid of the F-bomb and doesn't know when to quit.
  I think the original Laser Show can keep his spot at second, I throw like Chuck Knoblauch.
 Just took the Globe's which Red Sox player are you quiz... I'm Dustin Pedroia, sounds about right I guess.
 I kinda wish the cartoon Nerds on the candy boxes were real things. They look like they'd be fun little pets.
 RT  The roads of France need the rest day to recover from  
 Currently regretting staying up with the Red Sox.
 RED SOX WIN!!! Night y'all.
 Joe Castiglione still sounds fresh as a daisy.
 LASER SHOW! Red Sox take the lead!
 This game is nuts.
  I'd bring a few, I didn't cry, but there were a few parts where I considered it. Loved the movie, they did a great job.
 Josh Reddick a bawse.
 Ugh. I hate when "oh I'll just see how the Sox did" turns into sleep deprivation.
 Daniel Bard if you lose this game here your record will be 1-5. That's not pretty.
 Congrats to Mark Cavendish on the Stage 15 win, though really I wish Tyler Farrar had won too.
 Wow, apparently I've missed quite a game, I'm here now, Red Sox, you can go ahead and win now.
 Harry Potter was awesome!
  True story, I've had 2 Cosmos, I'm slightly tipsy. Happy, if you will.
 Slightly tipsy and headed to Harry Potter! Yay!
 The only thing sustaining me right now is that at the end of the day I get several cosmopolitans and Harry Potter.
 Wow, what a climb. Les Alpes are going to be an epic battle. Congrats to Jelle Vanendert on the stage win.
 Jens Voight is leading the pack up Plateau de Beille. He's bleeding from his 2 crashes so he may not be a robot after all, just BAD ASS.
 Ok Schlecks, giddy up...
 Oh no! Jensie hit the pavement this time. Bad day for the robot.
 Oh man, Jensie Voight went flying into the bushes, lucky landing there.
  I don't know, but he planted his face into the ground... yeeeowch.
  The guy on RaboBank who broke his nose.
 Just audibly went "ow" at that crash.
  Oh I am :) I think I actually enjoyed watching yesterday's stage more because I knew Thor had such an amazing ride going in.
  I think he'll be back sometime in August.
  I think we all want DiceK's money back. I don't not like Crawford, but we had cheaper talent in our own backyard.
 Aaaaand 11 minutes into TDF prime time coverage I just saw a minor spoiler. There goes a whole days work.
  Dude, those of us watching prime time coverage won't know that for 2.5 hours or so, horrible timing with the spoiler.
 Tour de France, Plateau de Beille time!
  I really wish we hadn't thrown all that money at Carl Crawford when we have Reddick and Kalish coming up.
 Red Sox win! And Joe Castiglione had an Obi Wan moment "that's not a laser show... it's a power surge..."
 RT  In 62 at-bats, Reddick has three homers and 17 RBIs. In 220 at-bats, J.D. Drew has four homers and 21 RBIs.
 Does somebody maybe wanna go check out Scutaro?
 Long day. Grocery store, running, then TDF time! I even managed to avoid spoilers so far today! Which means I'll fall asleep at like 8:42.
 GOD OF THUNDER! Amazing ride for Thor Hushovd today, huge congratulations on the TDF Stage 13 win!
  Or Marshall Mathers Motors... Emineminem
  I love my lobster, and my ice cream, but that sounds gross.
 Thor Hushovd  is a beast. BEAST.
 There is going to be an Olympic Curling/Hockey-esque hole in my life when this year's TDF is over, one for the ages so far.
 Tour de France!!! On a down not, poor Levi Leipheimer looks depressed, Team Radioshack is one hurting unit.
 Running, tucking in the ponies, and then will be glued to what promises to be an EPIC watching of le Tour de France Stage 13.
 Cannot wait to watch Le Thor this evening... Can. Not. Wait.
 Look at what Dutch Roomie got me!  
 Ugh. The beginning of 495 South is a parking lot.
 Headed back to NY. Lovely time in Maine, bummed I can't stay for the Sea Dogs game tonight.
 Maine People: Port Bean in Portland has excellent Whoopie Pies. A+. Good sandwiches too.
 RT  One Schleck, two Schleck. Red Schleck, blue Schleck. 
 Joyeux Jour de la Bastille a mes amis francais!
 Another stage, another loss for Contador. 
  I think he could have, but better to let Sanchez get the stage win, he did all the hard work, good etiquette for Frank Schleck.
 Contador lost 13 seconds to Andy Schleck and Evans and 33 to Frank Schleck, who suddenly looks like he could have ambitions of his own.
 Frank Schleck is now in second overall.
 Contador is finishing by himself, looks like he's hurting, lost 10-15 seconds, by my estimation, to Andy and Cadel. Voeckler keeping yellow.
 Congrats to Sammy Sanchez on the stage win! Frank Schleck coming in 3rd, Andy and Evans have dropped Contador!
 Frank Schleck is flying up the mountain right now.
 Frank Schleck has gone off the front, Andy, Contador, and Evans haven't gone with him so far.
 Frank Schleck looks great today.
 Andy is starting the cat and mouse games. Frank is playing too, Contador and Evans in the mix. Go Team Schleck!
 Nice to see Levi Leipheimer up in the main group too, be nice to see him get a stage win somewhere this year.
 Phil and Paul are a tad concerned about Andy Schleck. He's still in the main pack w/ Contador and Evans.
 Bought an  Tervis travel mug yesterday, put coffee in at 9:30 and it's still warm. Retiring my still working 10 year old LL Bean mug.

 Jens Voight back in front to lead the peloton up Luz-Ardiden. 
 Seriously, Jens Voight is a robot.
 Terrifying looking descent off the Tourmalet, be careful boys.
 I'd like to see Johan Bruyneel in charge of Leopard Trek and Andy Schleck at some point in the future.
 Terrible timing but he's back going, hopefully that's his bad luck for this year done and over with.
 Andy Schleck has punctured a front wheel and quickly changed in 10 seconds...
 I think Jens Voight is a robot. He's leading the charge of the peloton up the hill and making it look easy.
 Klodi is a gamer, still in the peloton and cruising up Tourmalet after another crash earlier today.

 Well this year's Vuelta slogan totally just ripped off a great Lance Armstrong quote.
 Tour de France time! So incredibly excited for Tourmalet and Luz-Ardiden tomorrow. And today's sprint finish, of course.
 Just saw a bumper sticker for Dook Fencing. I'm guessing those parents were proud of their honor student at one point too.
 Just ran the Boulevard, think Booty Loop CLT peeps, I miss running in the city!
 I love Maine! ( L.L.Bean Flagship Store) 
  No, she's not a little dog, she's just not my type personality wise.
 Heading up to Freeport for some shopping with Mom! And lobstah bisque at the Lobstah Cookah, best in Maine.
  Oh this dog has been around for a few years, she's just not my type of dog.
  Yeah, I just feel bad about it because I don't really like the new dog.
  Yeah, I just feel kinda bad because I don't really like the new dog.
 Just called my Mom's current dog by our old dog's name. In my defense they look a lot alike and I have never lived with the current pooch.
 Also Thor Hushovd with another top 10 finish. Tour de Thor?
 Congrats to Andre Greipel for getting the stage win today.
 Bummed Cavandish didn't get the win today.
  I've actually gotten on I87 at the border but was headed south after a misguided, tho pretty, detour through Lake Champlain
 I'm so going to le Tour one year. The whole thing. And I'm going drink wine and eat cheese and do a lot of hungover cycling.
  me too!
 Parents, its good to see you and all, but your wireless connection sucks.
  I love my Red Sox. And I live about 1.5 hours north of NYC.
 Thor Hushovd is currently riding in his socks. (watching more TDF than All-Star game)
 Made it to my parents house in Maine! (awhile ago actually.)
  I think I'm actually closer to Montreal when I'm home in NY.

 Riding ponies all day and then headed to Maine tonight! Hope I get there in time to see some of Stage 10 and maybe a little All-Star action.
 People in this bar are chanting "Asshole" at Big Papi on the TV. You stay classy New York.
 This might make me a snob, but I totally judge people on their etiquette. A fork is not shovel, hold it appropriately.
 I don't really care that much about the Home Run Derby, but good luck to Papi and Adrian this evening. I'll watch if it's on in the bar.
 RT  Here we go jens voigt on twitter 
  Good to know!
  I just know it'll be my luck that I'll use my upgrade and then next week they'll get a really cool new model or something.
  I really want a Bberry Torch, but Sprint doesn't carry them and I'm not switching providers, so prolly another Curve.
 Yeeeowch! Maybe NSFW RT  Johnny Hoogerland gets our Courage Award - hit by a car & lands on a barb wired fence?? 
 Nice and toasty warm today, I love this weather. The ponies are all camped out under their fans, I bet they're happy it's Monday.
  I am kind of excited for a new phone, but I've had this Blackberry for 2 years and I love it. Sad day.
 Have woken to a sad truth: When I knocked my Blackberry off the nightstand last night I cracked the screen. :(
 Dear Versus: Please, please put Craig Hummer back on the desk.
 You go Johnny Hoogerland! Way to finish! Chicks dig scars. Also, I want one of those King of the Mountain trophy girl dresses.
  Phil and Paul mulled it over, but no conclusive evidence shown so far... I prefer to think he just made a bonehead mistake.
  I have no idea, but if they don't they should make an exception in this case!
 Congrats to Luis-Leon Sanchez on the stage win today, sad to see Thor lose the maillot jaune, but he made it a great 1st week of the Tour.
  is hopefully in the unemployment line.
  I'm just glad he's toughing this stage out, that would be a terrible way to have to abandon!
  It might have helped more that hurt, more give on the landing than hard ground, but I hope he's up to date on his tetanus shot!
 Poor Johnny Hoogerland. Hope he can finish the day.
  They're my go to quick and easy snack/meal!
 Contador has eaten some asphalt today too. All on his own. Because he bounced off another rider. 
  If they reel in the breakaway here, Thor keeps the maillot jaune...
 Ok, so it was Hoogerland who went airborn, not Fletcher, thought both hit the deck spectacularly hard after being taken out by a tv car.
 Come on Hoogerland, get back on the bike and get your polka dot jersey!
 As Phil Liggett put it: Disgraceful.
 HOLY SHIT. They're getting taken out by tv cars now. Fletcher goes flying through the air and lands on a barb wire fence, he's ok though.
 OH. MY. GOD. I outweigh Alberto Contador by 3 pounds.
 Love all of Thor's lions on the front of the Garmin Cervelo bus.
 Sort of hoping Thor Hushovd somehow, miraculously, holds on to the yellow jersey again...

 le Tour.
  I miss their Mediterranean hummus.
 I really wish I had a Trader Joes here.
  I never had a problem with them either, loved Cal Jr and the 90s team, always sort of felt like we were partners against NYY.
 Just getting caught up on last night's Red Sox game. Who new the Orioles were such little bitches?
 Dear New York: I'm so completely done with this shit.
 Probably not going to get to watch much, if any, of le Tour this evening. :( So I cheated and read recaps... won't spoil, but YIKES.
 Funny how "I can't think of anything but how hungry I am" turns into "I can't think of anything except that I ate too much."  
 RT  Team Update: The team standings don’t look good for   are dead last.  leads the pack
 RT  I am laughing so hard at this that I can't breathe:   (via 
 And I'm done, reduced to a parking ticket. Win.
 I really hope they do this in alphabetical over the sign in sheet... Bored already...
  That's how I roll.
 I am one day away from becoming mayor of Rhinebeck Village Court. All because of one speeding ticket back in September...
 Trying to take care of my stupid speeding ticket. Again. Third time is the charm?
 I love this, but I'm not really sure why... 
 I miss the South. Friendly customer service say what? Do you actually want my business? Because I can and will go elsewhere lady...
  My family on my dad's side is Norwegian.
 Ok, flat stages are fun at the finish and all, but I'm ready for some mountains.
 Congrats to Edvald Boasson Hagen for winning the stage, if Thor couldn't do it at least it's still a Norwegian!
 Thor still in yellow, but poor Levi Leipheimer has lost about a minute after a late crash.
 Leipheimer just went down, back on and pedaling, but he's going to have to hustle to get back to the peloton.
 What's that Phil and Paul? Saxo Bank doesn't seem all that enthused about protecting Contador? Couldn't imagine why...
  it's actually not that bad if the horses are clean, and show horses usually are, but wet barnyards are always a bit smelly
 I'd imagine a bike race in the rain is just as miserable as a horse show in the rain, possibly with less mud and prolly no wet horse smell.
 If nothing else Contador is having to use lots of extra energy in all these flat stage shenanigans. 
 Contador having bike issues today, currently at the back of the field...
 OMG! People! on the grounds of a chateau!
 If I had property like that, a. there would be horses and b. you would be able to tell I lived there by the Red Sox logo cut into the lawn
 Why does it always look like the chateaux shown during TDF coverage are abandoned? No car in the driveway, just immaculate emptiness.
 Looks like Mark Cavendish wants a green jersey...
 I will be posting TDF spoilers again this morning...
 Red Sox win! for those of you keeping score at home that's win number 198 and 184 for Tim Wakefield. (get out of my brain Joe Castiglione!)
 This Red Sox game has featured a 1/2 hour-ish rain delay and still, so far, is under 3 hours. Tim Wakefield, I salute you & your efficiency.
 Boo  
 Jaysus H. Roosevelt Keerist... why are we talking about Brett Favre in any other role besides possibly commentating or HOF balloting?
  Agree, but beg to differ. Anyone ever daring to wave a rally or wtf-ever towel at Fenway gets their head on a stake on the Monstah.
  Was thinking mostly of Monday and the almost comeback and the 4th of July hat.
 Past decade or so only. They seem to be a better team when not wearing Hanging Sox abominations or holiday gear.
 I would like to see a study on the Red Sox win/loss percentage when they wear the classic navy/red B hat as opposed to other designs.
 Ellsbury is a full on stud tonight.
 All strike outs for Wakefield coming on the knuckleball... Really Remy? In other news, the Green Monster is green.
 JD Drew, still not worth $14/year, but nice catch there.
 YOOOOUUUK!
 Atta boy Ellsbury!
  It all ended well, great finishing sprint today!
 Lovely dinner with BFF and now home in time to see Wake. Settle in Timmy. Grip, kick, and throw, bud.
  Don't think I don't know what you're doing there.
 New favorite song to run downhill to: She's Country, Jason Aldean. Also, I miss my truck.
 Timmy Wake on the hill for the Red Sox tonight. I don't think it's possible to overstate my love for the man.
 One question, where the hell was Tyler Farrar today? Not up in the sprint at all...
 Today's Tour de France stage summed up: Carnage in Brittany and an exciting finish.
 What a finish! Great win for Cav!
  Didn't say I wanted that to happen, but the way today has gone... Crashes breed more crashes.
  haha, oh, I know my Nascar, just not as into it these days. I used to watch races on TNN. :)
 Wondering if the peloton is going to have a "Big One" (to borrow a nascar term) on the run in to the finish. Seems like that kind of day.
 I'm likely to get around to the mani/pedi, but everything else not so much. Like money? Like to vacuum? Come to my house.
 That could have been an awesome embarrassing ringtone moment.
 Things I should be doing today but I'm not because I'm watching le Tour: laundry, cleaning my house, oil change/car inspection, mani/pedi...
 I'm usually a Trek kind of girl, but that Cannondale Evo is hawt.
 Phil and Paul are getting a bit chippy.
  Best part is he had an extension, plus cell phone. I used to tell him his mom was calling over the intercom so everyone could hear
  When I worked in an office we had a guy whose mom would call the main office line at least once a week.
 Boonen literally gritting his teeth and back on the bike.
 Another crash, Tom Boonen and most of Quick Step just hit the pavement. Boonen is still down.
 Le Tour is taking no prisoners today. Popovych ate it at some point too. Still pedaling along though.
  I've actually seriously looked into going, there are some awesome bike tours out there.
 Wow, another nasty crash, only Nicki Sorensen involved, but safe to say there is some road rash happening there.
 Enjoying watching Contador fail with the glee usually reserved for A-Rod or Kobe. 
 It's not bad luck for Contador, Phil and Paul, it's karma. 
 Brajkovic is bandaged up and being carted off in an ambulance. Poor guy.
 Contador is back on a new bike and headed on his way back to the peloton. The back of his jersey is a little shredded. 
 Contador is down! Contador is down!
 Oh wow, new crash, Jani Brajkovic went down *hard.* He's up and moving, but looks pretty hurt.
 Brittany looks a lot like Maine.
 Nope, same crash, just now we know Leipheimer was delayed in it too.
 Twitter is telling me there is a second crash... Versus is on commercial...
 And we have the first crash of the day. Wiggins and Chavanel involved. Plenty of time to get back to the peloton. Very narrow roads today.
 I say this every year, but some summer I am going to go and follow le Tour around France.
 I hope Cav or Tyler win today. Or Thor, because Thor deserves a nice win after yesterday's ride. Long way to go today though.
 Yes, lets ask Mark Cavendish why he isn't winning stages and piss him off, that worked out well for everyone last year...
 Coffee, toast and le Tour! I will be posting spoilers this morning.
 Ok y'all, I will be posting TDF spoilers tomorrow morning, you've been warned.
 Alberto Contador went deep? I highly doubt that's what she said. 
 Alberto Contador still at 1:42 behind in the overall, can't wait to get up tomorrow and watch him fail some more.
 Quite happy The God of Thunder is still in yellow. Thor Hushovd has always been one of my favorites. Argyle is sexy.
  I had an inkling it was Evans anyway, saw half a spoiler earlier today, but Contador is still way far behind so we all win!
 Congrats to Cadel Evans, suck it Contador, and hats off to Thor Hushovd.
 Thor Hushovd is going balls out today. Love it.
  not done yet... but in the same group most likely
 I don't particularly care about Cadel Evans, but I love seeing George Hincapie still showing everyone how it's done.
 Well that was more exciting than it needed to be, but Red Sox win!
 RT  Lester left the game due to a left lat strain. 
 RT  Gotta love  skipper Clint Hurdle when asked if team scoreboard watches. "Some of our guys don't even realize we hav ...
 I agree with Phil Liggett, Thor/Cav intermediate sprint elimination yesterday was total bullshit. (Phil was more eloquent in his statement)
  It's not Johan Bruyneel is it? I mean, he's technically still competing...
