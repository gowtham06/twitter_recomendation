  ah. Didn't know that. Another question. What happened to Jankovic? Haven't seen her at all.
   just curious. Why was Bartoli's father allowed to come down to talk to her at 5-4 in 1st set yesterday?
  maybe "blown off" works better? "Stiffed" insinuates you're owed something.
  lol. That was my jam back in the day. Had a crush on one of those girls in the video.
  Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee...I love you, you from around the way.
  great song. Huge JB fan here.
  Moss--for sole reason that I wouldn't need a great QB to throw to him. W/Rice, u had to have a Montana/Young, IMO.
 Lmao at  listing Panthers picking up QB Derek Anderson as a positive.
  your new avi obviously has you sitting in LA traffic, haha.

 Only team(s) that worry me to the point that they are constantly on the brain are the Steelers and the Patriots. That's it, that's the list.
 Not scared. At all. RT  Jets & Eagles r shitting on everyone else w/ free agents. They want a super bowl & they want it now.
  none.
  in there at all. Walked by Apple store and it was packed as usual.
  of course. Actually thought I was in an Apple store for the first 10 seconds, that's how good it was. Same set up. Not many ppl
 Didn't even know these existed. Pretty impressive, too. ( Microsoft Store) 
 Always. RT   Ridin dirty?
 Just saw a dude that had gotten pulled over by cops; sitting on curb. If you're sitting on the curb, you're not driving your shit back home.

 If we get Mason back, cool, if not, so be it. Sending out one last "HEEEEEAAAP" in Heap's honor, and now, On to the next. 
 Sad to see Heap and McClain go, esp Heap. But, it's a business. And Dickson is looking like he can be a stud.Love the Leach signing. 
  damn. Thought they were outta play. Sucks, but I'm glad he's "home", and glad to not see him w/Jets/steelers.
  do you wear the clown makeup during it? 
  if the volatile Balotelli doesn't implode. Like Becks said, City is City, but they're not United. They can enjoy 4th place.
  ehhh "castoffs" is kinda strong. Castoffs would be guys who've been around awhile that nobody wants. These guys are 25, 25, 23!
 Wow they really must wanna give up yards. RT  Just got a text from Fabian Washington. He joins the Saints.

  damn. Odd. Did it happen during match?
  Domi walkover? Why??? *cries*

 Loss to Texas couple years ago much worse, IMO. They scored 30 effin runs!

  if true, it's also smart.

 I don't. RT  Davis and  Hunter will join  in NY tomorrow. And if you care, Izturis won't be activated from DL this weekend.

 The Town is on HBO tonight. I may hate their sports teams, but hard to find a shitty crime drama made in Boston. This rivaled Departed 4 me.
 81,000 for a preseason soccer game. In D.C. Impressive.

  your cab fare?? Damn, dude.
  totally.
  I enjoyed it. Think Wooderson grows up and becomes am attorney. Phillipe good in it too.
  oh ok, no shade. Was just asking. I think Ross is sick. Love what you guys do on the site.
 Well you already watched O's game, so killed 2 birds w/1 stoneRT  Semi Pro or Bad News Bears, in the mood for a Comedy movie..
 Welcome to LA, T.O. RT  The 405 is a zoo & the 10 isn't any better!! This traffic is bananas!!!
  as long as it didn't incapacitate me (and kept me handsome), I'd party harder than a mug and do bucket list ish.
   haha! So you also saw a winning team!
  cool avi.
  zero. All hope is w/Ravens, and they're learning a lesson our generation already knows. 
  but set the tone for season. Ballard was awesome on mound. Team full of gamers. That's what we lack today. Need gamers, not stars.
  Devo, Slak, The Mick, Cal of course. I remember Steve Finley (Fin Dog) crashing into wall opening day vs Sox, separated shoulder but
  is she a doctor? Some ppl handle concussions differently than others. Unbelieveable. B-Rob has earned mote respect than that.
  cried when fans rushed field to honor Earl and his last game. We have some great sports memories man. Sucks the youth today don't.
  totally. 3 games out 4 to go vs Brew Crew. Took first 3, Palmer on mound and Yount killed us.Goosebumps right now thinking about it.
  and it was all about the O's everyday. Buddies and I drinking beers and watching/listening to games. Final series was crazy. 
  hell some of them didnt even see '89. That was personally my favorite O's team/season. That summer had just graduates fromhigh school
  haha! You were in my head or vice versa. I'm about an hour behind catching up on my TL.
  probably the dumbest and most irresponsible thing I've even seen a sportswriter/personality write in my life.
  of course she is. That's the kind of shit I'm talking about. Starting to think  was right after all.
  your thoughts on Caps offseason moves? 
  and don't get me started about how awesome Boddicker was in that series. F you, LaRussa.
  like yesterday. I remember jumping around my house when Tito Landrum hit that game-winning homer vs White Sox in ALCS '83.
   espn had it as 6 earned.
  hopefully Doom shows up. He bailed last time I tried to see him.

 RT   Let the  and Frederick switch places. Frederick is where all the  best minor league talent is.
 RT   if baseball had relegation the Os would be in the Appalachian League by now
 At this point, the gap between the two isn't that wide.
 Money made when it comes to tv/sponsors/etc is literally millions. If baseball was like soccer, Norfolk would prob replace O's.
 Always a fight from those lower teams to finish out of the bottom 4. Yeah, you have no chance of winning the league, but the difference in
 In Europe, the worst 4 teams in the top league that season get demoted to lower league, replaced by top 4 in lower league. It's great.
 O's need to be relegated. 
  beyond killing. Embarrassing being a fan of this team.
 15-0. 
 Yes. 12-0. Most runs Yanks ever scored in 1st, most we've ever given up in 1st. Ever. RT   Seriously? Lol
  they just gave up 12 runs in the 1st. Screw it. Put everybody on the table.
 Haha! RT  Take the low road i will back u up RT  So hard to not respond to certain Baltimore (cont) 
 So it's real life? 12-0. I'm laughing right now to keep from crying. Know what? EVERYBODY is available for right trade. Fuck it. 
 Is something wrong w/my tv? Cuz I just turned to  game I I could've sworn it said 12-0 Yanks at the end of the 1st inning. Nahhhh.
 So hard to not respond to certain Baltimore sportswriters/personalities. And that's all I'm saying. 
 Kobe's at the game!  
 It's about time there's some good football played in FedEx Field. It's been awhile. 
 Yeah the MLS isn't anything to look at, but when the Euro teams come over they're rock star status.
 I love how ppl hate on soccer in this country. Man U/Barcelona sold out FedEx Field (with EASE) for what is pretty much an exhibition game.

  all the jackass Yankee fans all pissed off? That was my favorite part of working at Greens. Also when Sox fans went home mad.
  probably will be. I'll be drunk regardless, so it's a win for me.
 Had it all the way. 
 Winning run at plate. I think I know how this story ends. Seen it too many times at this stadium.
  I'm spending that entire weekend at Greens. It's like Xmas. Oh and tell "Wednesday" (Jessica) I said hi. She worked there yrs ago

 That game-winning TD Atlanta scored vs  last year is all you need to know about Josh wilson. Yeah it was OPI, but still.
  yesss
 Right now the Ravens starting corners are a rookie and a guy who hasn't played since '09. I'm 4th on the depth chart. 
  understand.
 Amy Winehouse performance from '07 on MTV right now. 
 Fine with Wilson leaving, to be honest. Never been a fan of 5'7" cornerbacks. 
   Thx for heads up.
  so you haven't seen the beginning? First 20 -30 mins are >>>>. Just overall a cool ass movie. Asks interesting questions.
 CB situation is pretty shaky. Again. 
  one of my favorites. Totally original (though based on a short story).
 Well alright then. Wow. Think its time to get in Asomug race.RT  Source:  CB Josh Wilson agrees to deal with Redskins
 We're  on  top10 worst umpire calls in MLB history. Congrats, Baltimore!
  signed him to win THAT game, his single game stats don't matter. He won DPOY. Brought the intangibles they wanted for 1 game.
  no, I'm going by him being the piece they needed to beat Dal finally in '94NFCC, cuz they couldn't touch them prior. They
  rubbed off on them. They finally believed they got the piece o puzzle to beat them. Belief CAN win games.
  not hating on Deion, he was vital. But SF DID need his braggadocio. '92, '93 Dal had their  Deion's confidence (arrogance?)
    what Deion brought was the swag they needed to beat Dal. Til then, Dal owned them in '90s.
 The Mariners lost 17 in a row and still have a better record than the  Sheeesh. 
  wonderful. Now going to bed :). Have a great day!
  just discovered your music (thx to True Blood) and absolutely LOVE your voice. Headphones+darkness+BlackListed=bliss.

  need to hear that.
  I have a friend who thought Abraham Lincoln was black. Seriously.
 I just discovered Neko Case. She is amazing. Beautiful, haunting voice. Check her out.
 Headphones on and listening to music in the dark is like the best thing ever, especially if it's someone w/a beautiful voice.

  ahhhhh, ok.
  Ana who though?
  haha!
  I see. Great bod.
  ah. Didn't know that. Another question. What happened to Jankovic? Haven't seen her at all.
   just curious. Why was Bartoli's father allowed to come down to talk to her at 5-4 in 1st set yesterday?
  maybe "blown off" works better? "Stiffed" insinuates you're owed something.
  lol. That was my jam back in the day. Had a crush on one of those girls in the video.
  Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee...I love you, you from around the way.
  great song. Huge JB fan here.
  Moss--for sole reason that I wouldn't need a great QB to throw to him. W/Rice, u had to have a Montana/Young, IMO.
 Lmao at  listing Panthers picking up QB Derek Anderson as a positive.

 If we get Mason back, cool, if not, so be it. Sending out one last "HEEEEEAAAP" in Heap's honor, and now, On to the next. 
 Sad to see Heap and McClain go, esp Heap. But, it's a business. And Dickson is looking like he can be a stud.Love the Leach signing. 
  damn. Thought they were outta play. Sucks, but I'm glad he's "home", and glad to not see him w/Jets/steelers.

   haha! So you also saw a winning team!
  cool avi.
  zero. All hope is w/Ravens, and they're learning a lesson our generation already knows. 
  but set the tone for season. Ballard was awesome on mound. Team full of gamers. That's what we lack today. Need gamers, not stars.
  Devo, Slak, The Mick, Cal of course. I remember Steve Finley (Fin Dog) crashing into wall opening day vs Sox, separated shoulder but
  is she a doctor? Some ppl handle concussions differently than others. Unbelieveable. B-Rob has earned mote respect than that.
  cried when fans rushed field to honor Earl and his last game. We have some great sports memories man. Sucks the youth today don't.
  totally. 3 games out 4 to go vs Brew Crew. Took first 3, Palmer on mound and Yount killed us.Goosebumps right now thinking about it.
  and it was all about the O's everyday. Buddies and I drinking beers and watching/listening to games. Final series was crazy. 
  hell some of them didnt even see '89. That was personally my favorite O's team/season. That summer had just graduates fromhigh school
  haha! You were in my head or vice versa. I'm about an hour behind catching up on my TL.
  probably the dumbest and most irresponsible thing I've even seen a sportswriter/personality write in my life.

  and don't get me started about how awesome Boddicker was in that series. F you, LaRussa.

 RT   if baseball had relegation the Os would be in the Appalachian League by now
 At this point, the gap between the two isn't that wide.
 Money made when it comes to tv/sponsors/etc is literally millions. If baseball was like soccer, Norfolk would prob replace O's.
 Always a fight from those lower teams to finish out of the bottom 4. Yeah, you have no chance of winning the league, but the difference in
 In Europe, the worst 4 teams in the top league that season get demoted to lower league, replaced by top 4 in lower league. It's great.
 O's need to be relegated. 
  beyond killing. Embarrassing being a fan of this team.
 15-0. 
 Yes. 12-0. Most runs Yanks ever scored in 1st, most we've ever given up in 1st. Ever. RT   Seriously? Lol
  they just gave up 12 runs in the 1st. Screw it. Put everybody on the table.
 Haha! RT  Take the low road i will back u up RT  So hard to not respond to certain Baltimore (cont) 
 So it's real life? 12-0. I'm laughing right now to keep from crying. Know what? EVERYBODY is available for right trade. Fuck it. 
 Is something wrong w/my tv? Cuz I just turned to  game I I could've sworn it said 12-0 Yanks at the end of the 1st inning. Nahhhh.
 So hard to not respond to certain Baltimore sportswriters/personalities. And that's all I'm saying. 
 Kobe's at the game!  
 It's about time there's some good football played in FedEx Field. It's been awhile. 
 Yeah the MLS isn't anything to look at, but when the Euro teams come over they're rock star status.

  oh cool. We gotta meet up sometime. There's some cool spots down here. If anything catch a Ravens game at Hooters!
  where you gonna be bro?
 And  RT  Jews you should follow on Twitter 
  they shoulda given him a pony tail or at least a goatee.

  like weed I can't do a damn thing after.

 Defense needs rebuild. RT  Yes we are. RT  "I don't think we're rebuilding. Period. We're Michigan." - Coach Hoke
 Don't go! Please! RT  Good time for me to join Twitter and start communicating with the fans as I make some important decisions.
  always look.
  Grape Nuts .....goodnight
  and that was all Elway, not anything Shanny did. Oh, and let's not forget Terrell Davis!
  say his name, Mike. It was Buster Olney! I tore him a new one saying he was dead wrong. Check my TL.
  lmao!
  damn tell me something I don't know. Is that broad 60? Looks like what you did to Alison.
 Nope, not it. RT   'Belechick' could be Belching, Belch, Ballcock, Bleaching, Belicia, Belushi, Bacchic, Belched, Belches...
  morning, Free!
 Calling it now. Haynesworth will have a breakout year and go to pro bowl. He HATED Shanahan. Will go hard for Belechick (sp?).
 Damn. RT  Filed to ESPN: Washington traded DT Albert Haynesworth to the New England Patriots for a fifth-round pick in 2013.

  I mean, is he crazy??? Stick to baseball Buster, b/c you obviously don't know football!
  getting him, and not having to start an overrated rookie QB.
  o-line schemes. His QB "development" is greatly exaggerated. Mcnabb still has game. You should be thanking football gods you're
  who has Shanahan developed? He's still riding Elway's coattails. He should be thanking Terrell Davis too. Shanahan is good at
  hoping to see you on more 
   awesome. The  Shield is the greatest cop drama ever west of Mississippi. The Wire the greatest east of.
      dope.
  haha! Why? B/c Connie looks really good at her age? You have nothing to worry about, Megan. 
  I just did :)
