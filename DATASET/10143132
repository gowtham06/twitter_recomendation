  I have only used barnacle a couple of times. I have wifi at home and at work. That's where i am most of the time. But it's good 2have
 Here is how to jailbreak your ipod i'll one or ipad.  
  i use a program called barnacle tether to make the phone into a wifi hotspots so i can use it with my ipad and laptop for no extra $$
  then i found a company that makes a dock that charges a second battery in the back. Perfect for rotating the batteries.
  ah. I got mine straight from google. I also got the dock and a couple of extra batteries.
  same here but im tired of mr jobs telling me what i can and can't do. As soon as the android tablets are out bye bye ipad.
  other than buying the nexus one and switching from the oppression of apple.   is the best decision i have made.
  after a couple of weeks my 32 gb. Iphone 3gs ended up on Craig's list.
  the nexus one is different. I originally bought it to use a second phone but quickly fell in love with it.
  read up  cyanogenmod.com, droid basement and the xda forums.
  but im using smart keyboard pro and its really smooth.
  its a great phone right out of. The box though. The only thing i had to get used to was the keyboard. Iphone has a better one.
  i was kinda worried i might ruin my new phone but it was totally worth it. Take your time though. You'll know when it's time.
  I. Rooted mine and put cyanogen rom on it. Ovecloked to 1.13 ghz

  cool i know you'll be happy with it.
