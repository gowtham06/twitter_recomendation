 I don't see a president among the Republican hopefuls. I see Obama serving 2 terms. I knew McCain would never be president.
 We are all godlets. We are all immortal whether we realize it or not. How vain man to think he can destroy another soul.
 I wonder what it's like to live in a world where everyone is clairvoyant and highly developed? Where everyone recognizes divinity.
 People fully aware of Universal Law who fully realize that what they do to others will return to them tenfold? That would be an interesting
 I hope to reincarnate next time on a planet without wars. Now wouldn't that be something? People conscious enough to live peacefully?
 In my opinion, war is big business and the ammunition folks don't care much about loss of lives. They just want to sell guns and ammo.
 We lost all those American lives in Vietnam and still didn't win the war. World War II we won or we'd all be speaking German.
 We supposedly left Iraq and there is still plenty of terrorism and death there. Now what about Afghanistan???
  Eat butter, not margarine. Eat real food. Or you'll get fatter! Honest!
  Vaccine cures prostrate cancer in mice!!!
  Take enough Vitamin D. Essential for your health! 5000 mg 5x a week.

 Do ebooks and make your own artistic decisions. Refine your talents and take pride in your work. Accept criticism, graciously.
 The writer gets 5-10% and the bookstore makes 20-60% Is that fair? The bookstores are coming to a close as well. It's just a matter of time.
 The time of the mainstream publisher is coming to a close. The artist-writer has been taken advantage of far too long.
 The way of the future is ebooks. No agent. No bookstore, per se. Do use an editor for the best presentation. Do take pride in your work.
 Amazon still makes 30% at least on Kindle. Check out smashwords.com They pay the author 85%. Amazon won't accept them yet. Imagine that?
 All you authors, please do EBOOKS. It's the booksellers who have made most of the money for the past century or more 20-60%

 I always thought Richard Burton was her soulmate. His Scorpio Sun was on Elizabeth's moon and they did marry twice.
 However, I wonder which of her dearly departed talented husbands is trying to show around the heavenly mansions today?

 I don't see a president among the Republican hopefuls. I see Obama serving 2 terms. I knew McCain would never be president.
 We are all godlets. We are all immortal whether we realize it or not. How vain man to think he can destroy another soul.
 I wonder what it's like to live in a world where everyone is clairvoyant and highly developed? Where everyone recognizes divinity.
 People fully aware of Universal Law who fully realize that what they do to others will return to them tenfold? That would be an interesting
 I hope to reincarnate next time on a planet without wars. Now wouldn't that be something? People conscious enough to live peacefully?
 In my opinion, war is big business and the ammunition folks don't care much about loss of lives. They just want to sell guns and ammo.
 We lost all those American lives in Vietnam and still didn't win the war. World War II we won or we'd all be speaking German.
 We supposedly left Iraq and there is still plenty of terrorism and death there. Now what about Afghanistan???
  Eat butter, not margarine. Eat real food. Or you'll get fatter! Honest!

 Do ebooks and make your own artistic decisions. Refine your talents and take pride in your work. Accept criticism, graciously.
 The writer gets 5-10% and the bookstore makes 20-60% Is that fair? The bookstores are coming to a close as well. It's just a matter of time.
 The time of the mainstream publisher is coming to a close. The artist-writer has been taken advantage of far too long.
 The way of the future is ebooks. No agent. No bookstore, per se. Do use an editor for the best presentation. Do take pride in your work.
 Amazon still makes 30% at least on Kindle. Check out smashwords.com They pay the author 85%. Amazon won't accept them yet. Imagine that?
 All you authors, please do EBOOKS. It's the booksellers who have made most of the money for the past century or more 20-60%

 I wonder how big the vacuum cleaner is? Handheld? Just thinking about it still cracks me up!
 I had to sign my income tax returns on this Void of Course moon and run 10,000 errands.
 It seems I never have quarters when I need them for parking meters. I got lucky today. No quarters, but I wasn't ticketed!
 I still think the guy stealing coins from laudramats with a vacuum cleaner was pretty clever. I never thought of that!
 He must have been a pretty fierce barker. The guy, not the dog!
 Then this other buy got arrested for barking at a police dog...but he says the dog started it! Talk about ridiculous.
 The vaccum cleaner is still at large! No arrest made so far.
 This guy got arrested for vaccuming coins out of these laundramats. I'm sorry, but that story really cracked me up. I'm still laughing.

  Elizabeth Taylor on her near death experience.
 Clients showed up an HOUR late. How rude! Did the readings anyway. I mean a psychic has to make a living too.
 I'm sad about Elizabeth Taylor today, and now my 2 clients are standing me up. HOW RUDE. No more appts for them.

 I always thought Richard Burton was her soulmate. His Scorpio Sun was on Elizabeth's moon and they did marry twice.
 However, I wonder which of her dearly departed talented husbands is trying to show around the heavenly mansions today?
 What a beauty! What eyes! A terrific actress and philantrophic human being. Elizabeth Taylor will be missed.
