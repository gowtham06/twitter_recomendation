 I may actually be in the mood for knitting again soon. Bet my hands will think it's weird after a month not knitting. ;)
 Happy end of  I have five empty bobbins + one full, which is good 'cause that's only one bobbin at risk of abandonment. ;)
 I'm not sure whether I'm going to finish my final skein of yarn for the  today. MEH. Send poking vibes if you got 'em.
 So far I am kicking the butt of me-of-last-year at the  Yeah. Woo. Ha. Coo. I have seven skeins finished already!
  Ha, ha ... I'm here and then GONE! ;) But it's nice to be seen, and to see others, like you & your friendly face. ;D
 Has anyone ever done knotted-pile weaving? I'm trying to figure out how to try it on my rigid heddle.
 I am such a bad pirate. Or maybe a good pirate but a bad user of social media. But I promise I'm still alive, O lovers of yarn and crafts!
  DOH. I totally forgot to join Team Social. I am so smrt. Well, I posted on that thread, anyway. ;D Thanks for linkage!
 There are sure a lot of trindles on the  daily progress threads. Nooooooo! Do not tempt me, trindle owners!
  agree(1) Eating ice cream sounds like a good way to celebrate TdF day 1. And is there really a  ;D
 Almost done spinning my 2 oz of Juniper-colored Louet top. Note to self: More gets done when you spin whimsically. 
 Sometimes I think there needs to be a "Wow" button to click on Ravelry. (And a "thanks" button would be nice, too.)
 Day 1 of the  is going pretty well so far. :D Spun an ounce of yarn this morning:  
 Oo, just found  tips on sewing with handwovens. Awesome. Maybe they'll help me be brave enough to try: 
 Thank you, Tour de Fleece planning, for giving me a use for basic algebra. I still need to figure out how to use sines and cosines, though.
 I have a whole bunch of Trellis ribbon yarn and I have no idea what I want to do with it. Eep.
 Holy crappity, the Tour de Fleece is in just a few days. I really did drop off the planet for a few weeks! ;)
 Oh, lace scarf, you've fought me from the start. Even on the blocking board I find something to fix ... sigh. Well, soon it'll be done. ;)
 Uh-oh, time for the Interweave Hurt Book Sale! Gotta find some extra money for craft books now ... ;)
 Also, in case anyone was wondering: Blocking mats are the opposite of resistant to cat claws.
 WHEW. I swear there are more pins in that little rectangular slip of lace than I needed to make a big cartridge-pleated costume skirt.
  Oooops! Super-belatedly, I know solar dyeing works here, so I bet setting TeeJuice in a hot car is a fair shot ... ;)
 Knit lace rectangle to me: Oh, you thought blocking was easy? Hahahahahahaha...
 Did some craft room reorganizing today ... woo. It's now in that lovely "looks worse than when I started" stage. ;)
 I now have a fabric steamer. Er. Is there something I can do with this aside from steaming clothes, drapes, and maybe yarn? ;)
  The sticking toschedule part is where that plan falls apart for me, too. ;) Someday I'll come up with a clever fun way to do it!
 And now, back to working on the endless scarf ... or maybe to read for a little bit, and THEN work on the scarf.
  Saaaame here. This lack of weekend-feeling is something I suspect I can remedy, someday, with some tricky scheduling, though. ;D
 RT  Ahh, Sunday morning. Which is like any other morning, really. Sometimes I miss that special fe… (cont) 
 Also, weird fact of the day: I am currently knitting two unrelated bright yellow lace objects with flower themes as gifts for different ppl.
 And the usual round of sincere thanks to  for the  mention. :D
 Working on my endless recycled yarn lace scarf. Why did I think I could finish this in a couple of weeks, again? ;)
  Moose hair? ;) (For a second there I thought you had ordered a moose. Ha.)
 Wondering who wrote this caption in Vogue Knitting; whoever it is seems to think kimonos are ... severe? Not a word I would have used. ;)
 Mehhh. Need to work on a project, but it's turned into kind of a tedious slog. If it were for me I think I would be closer to frogging it...
 Officially calling it: I will never see the end of my Ravelry knitting queue. (Well, unless I go to the final page, but you know. ;))
 DUDE. This Spock Hat *with ears* is hilarious and awesome:   
 Recycled a commercial cotton sweater into yarn. Looks like there's more than enough to make the cardigan I was looking at — woo!
 Oh, and a belated  thanks to  ;) Appreciation, appreciation!
  I liked your egg, but I like your fibery goodness better. ;D
 For some reason I keep wanting to try free-form knitting, like on freeform knit 365:   Anyone else do it? :D
  Hahaha! According to Twitter I'm your personal account's first follower! I win! ;)
 Oops. Did I forget to link to my latest blog post with pics of proof I've actually been finishing things lately? ;) 
  I'm either psychic ... or you mentioned it in your previous tweet, one or the other. ;)
  Cool! Thanks for the tips on Finn. That saves me the trouble of trying the Louet stuff and getting put off. ;D
  No, I loooooove BFL for spinning, too. ;D Enough that I want to make sure I don't get stuck there and not explore anything else.
  Yeah, wool + alpaca is an awesome combo. :D
  Any recommendations on good sources of Finn? :D
 Hey, spinners and other fibery people! What's your favorite fine wool? :D
 I want to knit something new, but I don't know what. 
 The cats have indeed been walking on my shawl as it blocks, and trying to steal the blocking mats. Foolish, foolish kitties.
  (And okay, my own mild incompetence and lack of attention-paying strikes again. ;))
  DUDE. That last tweet should have been from here. TweetDeck strikes again. ;)
 Dry, shawl, dry! Dry, shawl, dry! Not that I can wear you around the house in the 85-degree weather, but I can sneak a try.
  Oops, belated reply time! Your secret's safe with me (and I hope with Twitter)! Is your singles still on the bobbin? ;D
 Hmm. If I bought another set of interlocking blocking mats I think I could block anything short of a blanket...
 First time blocking a lace shawl today. Whew. I now cross fingers that no cats will take a fancy to it while it is thus vulnerable.
 Navajo-plying some singles from (shhh) last year. Gotta clear off the bobbins before the Tour de Fleece.
  Love your latest Twitter icon! ;D (I'm probably super-belated on that...)
 Apparently you can use a pasta machine to take the seeds out of cotton bolls. Cool. ;D YouTube video (not mine): 
 Dude, the printer needs another new ink cartridge. Second time this week. That's what I get for not buying the whole set at once. ;)
 I should so not be allowed to knit lace without lifelines. Sigh.
 The little tags I just hand-sewed onto this floofy knit scarf remind me of little quilted patches. Ha.
 I have a sense that my old-school geeky live chat self may live again on Ravelry soon. Yeah. Trolling for chat rooms that are open...
 Ha! I just discovered that Ravelry forums with chats running Right Now have a little speech bubble by them. That is the Coolest Thing Evar.
 Ever have one of those days where you can't seem to do usual things quite right? Yeah, having one of those. Sigh.
 Rearranged some of my old scrapbooking supplies. It's amazing how much more fun playing with paper is when you can actually get to it. ;)
 Thankee to the darling  &  for your  mentions. ;D
 Or maybe the yarn is holding like half an ounce of humidity. That would be, errr ... annoying, to say the least. ;)
 I feel like I'm going to get to the middle and the last two yards are going to weigh half an ounce by themselves. ;)
 This is the weirdest ball of yarn ever. It's like an inch smaller in diameter than it was, but it only weighs 0.2 oz less than it did.
  I'm usually like "Oh, cute!" when I see moths outside, but inside, I start to feel a little murderous. ;)
 You know you're a fiber person when small moths indoors make you nervous. No matter what they look like.
 Also: While I do indeed wish to knit more shawls, I need to stop finding awesome knitalongs. I do not have time for all this KAL! 
 Finally starting Chart B of my Traveling Woman shawl. FI. NAL. LY.
 I need a crafty time-out from my most recent active projects. But at the same time I want to finish them, THEN take a break. Hrmph.
 Knitting this huge pink scarf is making me want a big chunky knit blanket in BFL wool. I wonder how many pounds of wool that'd take...
  I have a semi-opposite problem — I am apron-resistant, but after baking & subsequently knitting, I think I need one...
  Tres ridiculous! ;) I made my sister an "I Love Lucy"-style apron last year. From a kit bcs I = lazy sometimes.
 80% done with the gigantic pink scarf. The end is in sight! Then I get to wash a pound of wool scarf.
 For some reason it's been really hard to convince myself to knit today. I may be a tad burned out. Oh, well, gotta do what I gotta do. ;)
  This one?  There are a few results for "tulip" and "tulips" amongst the cardigans ... ;)
  Tulip Cardi? Will check it out! Thanks! :D
 Poking about on Ravelry for small, cute-but-not-cutesy cardigan patterns for a fall cardi KAL.
 So ready to take a little break from thinking about fiber right now. A cup of tea, a little light reading — then back to knitting.
  Aww, thanks for the RT! *wavewave* You, as always, are awesome. ;D
 Yay! The story of a skein of yarn, from fleece to fiber art, with lots of pictures:  
  Dude, I thought you meant spotted dog like the pudding, for a second there. ;)
 Thanks for the  love to  and  ;D
 Anyone know what SNDR stands for when it's in front of an alpaca's name?
 That alpaca fiber turned into art yarn, semisolid & thread-plied ... a far cry from the traditional 2-ply I thought it'd be. ;)
  Oh, are you using a pattern for the cardi or making up your own? Just wondering what pattern! ;D
 Taking a break from fiber prep, then once more unto the breach of spinning this alpaca!
 One reason spinning samples before starting a project is good: Sometimes the fiber REALLY doesn't want to be what you want it to be. ;)
 Dude, I forgot how long it takes me to spin laceweight. Especially this stuff. Grumble grumble.
 Hey, hand carders. Let's go bother some alpaca fleece, shall we?
  LOL — no, eye tooth awareness is a sign of wisdom, not old age! ;)
 Behold! Photos of the finally-finished Epic Socks AND of the huge pink scarf that's breaking the sound barrier: 
  And hey, that takes the effort out of deciding on pricing! *writes down* One bottle of obsessive finishing for one eye tooth. ;)
 So. I wonder how fast I can conceivably expect 4 oz or so of raw alpaca fiber to dry with a fan pointed right at it. GO FIBER GO!
  And awww! If I were a blushing gal I'd blush. Happy to assist with the quest for fun. ;)
  I should figure out how to bottle and sell it, huh? ;D
 (It appears that my UFObusting instinct is rearing its head.)
 I have this slightly mad urge to pick a knitting UFO and keep knitting until I either finish it or fall asleep on top of it.
 (By which I am incompetently attempting to imply that fiber crap is keeping me from sleeping like a reasonable person. ;))
 I am the Unsleeping Pirate! I wish the fiber in the Crock Pot would cool down fast all by itself. ;)
 Thank goodness I have a working fan now. It makes it so much more convenient to hand-wash stuff when it actually dries in a day or two. ;)
 Going to move from the computer desk to the futon ... This project is getting too large for just my lap to handle. ;)
 Dude, I just realized I typed "every sock leg" when I meant "every sock foot."  
   agree(1)! And nighty night. ;D
   Ha, ha! *That's* why I keep missing all the fun! 
   ... until suddenly the toe decreases are upon me and I'm paranoid I've knit too long. ;)
   Though "I keep knitting but it doesn't get any longer" sounds like every sock leg I've knit...
   a) Knitting a black hole is oddly appealing. b) Putting  in geo… (cont) 
 I swear this yarn with these needles knits up at two rows per inch. 
  And in black yarn it'd feel like two lifetimes. I'd need two lifetimes' worth of eyes, too. 
  Holy crappity, I don't even want to think about how long it'd take to knit 72 inches of 12-inch-wide scarf on tiny needles...
  Big needles it is! Though big needles or no, it'll still take me a while to knit 72 inches of scarf. ;)
 Maybe both, in succession...?
 Next question: Knit giant pink yarn on big needles, or skinny black yarn on tiny needles? Hrrmmmm...
 Went with turquoise with a sprinkle of sky blue and yellow. Now, cross fingers, turn on Crock Pot, and wait.
  Your outing gives me comfort.  ;)
  There was a TV news spot on it, IIRC. I was pretty impressed; they seemed very polite. Not that I know lots of rude camelids. ;)
 Must avoid dyeing said alpaca all of the above, since this yarn is not going to be for me, but for a mostly unknown quantity. ;)
 Now to decide what color to dye this alpaca. Blue, green or purple were the suggestions ... and I have all of the above. Eep.
  Like the ones I saw once that lived in someone's house. Or was that llamas? It was a while ago so I don't remember.
  Ha, ha ... A prim and proper alpaca. Maybe one who wants his or her nails clipped and wears a bow or a bowtie.
  I could definitely use a few more OCD sheep fleeces, though, ha. ;D
  It's actually alpaca, which kinda makes it weirder, since they supposedly like rolling in dust, you know?
 Maybe I bought a washed alpaca fleece without realizing it. That'd be pretty funny. ;)
 I think this is the cleanest fleece I have ever washed. Ever. There's ... like ... not even dust in it. 
  Awesome. ;D Looking forward to seeing what comes of all the sparklethoughts.
  And if it counts for anything, I would totally knit a sparkly shawl out of sock weight yarn.
  And I think something in this color:  would be super awesome with sparkle. ;D
  I think it'd work, personally. The sparkly sock yarn I reference was a fairly bright turquoise and I still think it's lovely. ;D
  Some of the first sock yarn I ever bought was sparkly, and one of the first shawls I made was sparkly, too! ;D
  I would LOVE sparkly sock yarn and lace yarn. Love love love.
 Er, put them off TILL tomorrow. Proofreading fail.
 I should not be a slacker and put off the washing and dyeing tomorrow. I laugh in the face of midnight! Wahahaha!
 I keep getting totally derailed from washing some raw alpaca fleece I meant to have dyed by now. DOH. 
 Because steampunk is already historically inaccurate, and the patterns aren't for painful movie knockoffs. Yay! ;)
 Although the Simplicity costume patterns have often given me miniature heart attacks, I give their steampunk collection a thumbs up.
 The  mystery poster will have pirates, bacon AND a sheep shooting eye-lasers. How could I not pre-order one? ;) 
 Hmm ... Sock-knitting may be in my immediate future. Ta for now, mates.
  My mom is Chinese born in Indonesia, but she speaks Dutch, because — well, you know!
  Bacon bot! As far as bots go, that doesn't sound half bad.
  Hey, cool, my mom is from Indonesia. ;D Not that that's at all relevant, but the vague connection is kind of entertaining.
  But bacon and knitting make a good garnish? ;D
  Which part, the megapink yarn? ;D
  DOH. I should have mentioned it before: There's a 10¢ deal for it at Interweave right now: 
 My life lately: spinning a pound of BFL, knitting a handspun shawl, and finishing those beaded lace socks.  
  Re: Respect the Spindle, I haven't actually seen the book, so I can't compare. The vid was 10¢ so I had to check it out. ;)
  Belated response time! My day was absorbed by big fat pink BFL yarn. ;)
 Watching the Respect the Spindle video is tweaking my spindle-buying urge. I want a Bosworth, or a Golding, or ... or ... ;)
  What kind of fiber are/were you spinning, anyway?
  Is that your shirt showing in the next shot? ;) I like it!
 Yeah, action shot, woo! ;D // RT   Using one of your spindles today.  
  Delayed reaction from yesterday: DUDE. COOL! ;D I hardly ever get to see action shots!
 Possibly today is the first time I've ever made two separate batches of the same recipe in one day ... ;)
   Thanks! ;D I'm going to count it as a bonus if I manage to cast on the second of the pair tonight...
 Wahaha! I finished a sock. Only took me mumblemumble months. *snort* Including knitting almost a whole sock at the wrong gauge...
 Look! Socks on the beach & frilly things on my blog!  
 Still need to figure out what crochet project to do next, though. Suggestions are welcome. ;D
 Package in the mail, dyed fiber drying, undyed fiber soaking in prep for being dyed. Now there's an unborn sock toe with my name on it.
 Plan for the rest of the day: Weigh fiber, play with wire and hammer, activate Dyepot of Doom, knit a sock toe.
 Whew. What a week last week was. What have I missed? ;)
 Do I knit before heading off to a housewarming party? Yeah, I guess I do. Lace socks, get ready.
 In need of tea. I spy a brass tea kettle that warrants attention.
  OMG. I have always wanted a hammock. Someday I too will have one. Maybe I will MAKE one. ;)
 I went picture-crazy in my latest blog post. Want to see my newest sharp objects & haphazard baking?  
  Hmm, iced tea and rum sounds doable ... If I have any pirate parties this summer I should try it. ;D
  I think I need much stronger tea for a rum + tea combo ... ;)
 Grumpy pirate alert! Going to go see if a nice cup of tea will soothe the savage sailor-type-person. ;)
 is now the proud owner of two rotary cutters, thanks to a kindly gift card. Woo.
 It's my craft blog's blogiversary! Yayyy, I remembered in time! ;) To celebrate, yarny pics & a coupon code:  
 RT  Needle-felting is great for venting frustration when you're feeling kind of stabby...  
 (...and probably, eating something would restore some of my command of language and concepts ... ;))
 Anyway, while I'm waiting on cowly thoughts, I think I will go and knit lacy socks. Must defeat the massive knit-UFO horde!
   Oh, and I mean visibly heavier on the pseudo than the vintage inspiration & creativity. Need better words. ;)
   But when something is PSEUDO-vintage there's about a 50% chance I'll hate it ... or LOVE it. ;)
   Yeah, my resistance to bandwagon lowers as the trend gets closer to actually vintage.
   The client is now mulling over cowls. Thanks for the ideas — without my tweeps I wouldn't even have asked. ;)
   Sometimes I start to even feel twinges of bandwagon allergy when it comes to fiber arts. Very un-useful. ;)
   I was beat over the head with cowl patterns while Rav searching for chunky yarn/low yardage patterns. ;)
   I've been kind of waffly about cowls — I've always liked them but sometimes I have a bandwagon allergy.
  Pretty sure there will be pics on the blog once it's done. Of the entire process. ;) I've been slacky about posting them...
   Maybe I'll ask about the cowl thing anyway. He's been pretty specific, but you never know...
  Gonna make a whole 'nother batch of yarn. The nitpicker in me can't find any way out of it (and it's been trying). ;)
 OMG a spurtle! I totally want one of these.  I have a cookbook that mentions them and I would sooooo use it.
 Time to buy more fiber! Ha...
  If it were for me, I probably would, but it's a custom order and he specifically wants gigantofat yarn, soooo ... ;)
  I console myself with the fact that aside from my estimate of how much wool it'd take, my math & spinning were right on. ;)
  A giant fat poofy scarf! Of course, I need about twice as much yarn as I currently have to make the size I want. 
 Takin' my size 13 needles and hangin' out with some fat pink yarn. Yeah. Woo.
 Pretty sure this pink three-ply is the fattest yarn I've spun to date ... At the very least the center-pull balls are giganto.
  Ha ... No, I'd think it would tell you to do a provisional CO if it meant that. ;) But I wanted to ask just in case...
 Man, I need a brain tune-up. Or a vacation. Or maybe that's redundant. ;)
  Anyway, I totally need to try provisional CO + circs someday. Curious: Did your pattern say to undo the long-tail sts?
  So then I got to fudge around with eight dpns to get the two sets of stitches to line up parallel. ;)
  Doh. I wasn't being very clear: I meant the pattern said to move the CO sts onto dpns BEFORE bringing CO edge to live sts.
  And it seemed like it'd have been easier to bring the CO edge to the live stitches if both were on circs rather than dpns...
  To bring the CO edge behind the live stitches, that is. Bcs that was the order in which the pattern said to do it.
  that really got me the first time was trying to use two sets of dpns at once and manipulate them through each other. ;)
  No worries. ;D The pattern I'm using left me a choice of provisional COs, so I did a crochet one, with dpns. The thing
  Made it less rage-inducing. ;) Possibly hemmed cuffs are easier if you use circular needles...
  The second time I did it, I only transferred the cast-on sts to the dpn that I was going to be using immediately.
  Well, good. ;D I'm inching, too, though not quite as well as you are, I think. ;)
 Now I need to find some fiber I only have about an ounce of, that would make good lace. Off to shop the stash...
 Hahaha! Evil beaded hemmed cuff, I have VANQUISHED you!
  See, if it's figurative then I have to ask what you mean by it. So what not-physical places are you going? ;D
  Took almost the same amount of time, but I wanted to murder the first one. This one not so much.
  Mine is a hemmed cuff, too! These things take SO. LONG. It's my second one ever. Went better than the first one. ;)
  Going places sounds like fun. Literally going places, or figuratively? ;)
  Halloooo! How's things? One more dpn to go for this sock cuff of doom...
 Oy. This is the Sock Cuff of Forever-Taking.
 Woo. 240ish yards of Navajo-plied socky-weight yarn. One more bobbin to go, but I don't think I'm going to get to it tonight...
 Having a fractious day. Maybe Navajo plying will get the randomness out of my system.
 Also avoiding re-swatching for a project I may have to frog entirely. Grumble grumble. But a knitter's gotta do what a knitter's gotta do.
 Going through knitting needles, organizing projects. Winter cleaning has officially turned into spring cleaning. ;)
 Whew. Taking self-portraits is hard work. Dern bio pics. No one needs to know what I really look like, right? ;)
 Ha! Love this blog post from   Makes me feel better about the cost of craft supplies. ;)
 There are like two million loose ends hanging over me right now, oysh. Going to go try to spin my way through one of them!
  It's funny how I took the project on as a challenge, but I was actually defeated by bad writing, not difficult knitting. ;)
 (The pattern is attached to a UFO that's *ahem* several years old. It put me off socks for a long time, honestly.)
 I promise I gave it a good try. I just thought *I* sucked & socks were Really Hard. Now that I've knit more, I realize it was the pattern.
 Not naming names, but dude. This pattern is so badly-written that to finish knitting it, I am going to have to rewrite it for myself.
 I printed little mini cards with yarn on them! I feel strangely competent. Except for the fact that my trim marks were useless ... ;)
 Off to play with Illustrator. Working on some yarn-related arty stuff. ;D
 Hrrmm. What kind of tea goes with pouring rain?
  Sometimes I actually enjoy it, but a lot of times I need to do it when I just don't feel like it. ;)
  They're all I have, I swear. ;) Though now that I have a better lighting situation I should stop whinging and take pics.
  I've been maundering to myself about whether I want to add a crocheted or knit edging, as my excuse for not photographing it. ;)
  Meh, you can kind of see it here:  and here:  but clearly those are not OF the shawl. ;)
  Somewhere, there's a photo of it being used as a display at a craft event ... Lemme see if I can find it...
  Which is kind of funny, since I have a handwoven cream-colored shawl sitting around waiting to be photographed. Snortle.
 O man, I just had a random shawl pin idea. The toolbox is sucking me toward it like a rare earth magnet...
  Thankee most kindly for your RT! :D
 I've been wanting to make a rainbow shawl pin for a while, and I finally did. Woo! ;D   
 Dark and cloudy here, for four in the afternoon. Guess it's going to storm!
 I hope the rest of this ridiculously-colorful-in-a-good-way treasury on  is also craftily contagious: 
 Oops, lost a space in there. *hangs head*
 Thiscolorful free-form crochet shawl makes me want to pick up the crochet hook again. Awesome crafting is contagious. 
 My wheelspun yarn is so not the same as my spindle-spun yarn...
  is making me want to break out my spindle again. It's stuck with some superfine thready turquoise yarn on it ATM. *shame*
  You're welcome. May it serve you well and provide much easy nom. ;)
  There you go, super-easy drop scones on the griddle recipe in your inbox. Woo.
  Actually, I'll send you the recipe. Ha. ;) It'll be my excuse to answer an e-mail from you from long ago.
  They're not just like the baked kind of scones — more like pancakes — but they're better cold than any pancakes I've ever had.
  I send drop-sconey vibes to you! Though they were actually super-easy, which is why I made them. One bowl + a frying pan.
  About the same here, though it's been lots of tea and drop scones instead of muffins, heavy on the work vs. the relaxation. ;D
 Off to go play with tools and wire. (Meaning it's shawl-pin-making time!)
 ...or maybe I'm really just trying to figure out what my shawl pin symbolizes as part of the significant course of one person's life. ;D
 My newest shawl pin is in a treasury called "My life in one day" — a mysterious name I don't know the story behind ... 
 Looking at the Ravatars for ppl who have favorited the Heel Flap Scarf is like looking at friendly faces. ;D The scarf: 
 OMG, I put up my  check-in for this week before noon. Still going slowly:  
 I wonder if trying t-shirt recon tutorials on about three hours of sleep is a good idea or a bad one. Hmmmm. ;)
  Apparently I can't even keep my mind on Twitter today ... ;) Something must be hiding in my brain and taking up all my resources!
  They're definitely an interesting concept. Hrrmmm. Trying to figure out where they fit into my online info consumption habit. ;)
  It does sound cool! ;D Do people really read them?
  Ooh, it's me! Thanks! ;) What *is* that daily thingie about, anyway? My lack of cool is showing — I don't really get it ... ;)
 And a predictably late but still heartfelt thanks to  for the steadfast  love!
 Got one lone new shawl pin listed in the shop today, ruby red:   
 Working on shawl pins & new designs all day makes a fiber pirate tired. Still have to knit, though. Gotta earn my Aubrey and Maturin.
 Just joined the  team. Woohoo! Does that mean I get a Real Weaver card now? ;)
 Strangely tired ... but I still have knitting to do. Yawns, tea and tiny knitting needles ahead for me...
  Thanks! ;D I should probably stop compulsively checking the downloads page now, though ... ha...
 Baffled by the  of downloads of the new scarf pattern today. That many people now have my PDF. On their computers. 
 I really want to make t-shirt yarn. Tried once, but my choice of t-shirts was flawed ... It was old enough to crumble at the edges. 
 Yayyy! My new  pattern is up on  It's a ribby-textured skinny scarf — and it's free! ;D 
 New knitting pattern in layout — finally. Need to proof it and then maybe, maybe it will show up on Ravelry today. ;D
 Anyone remember the early 70s and know what a "shrink top" is?
 Oh, noooo, the washer/dryer needs service. Crap on a stick.
 It's World Storytelling Day! So I talk about stories for  today:  Do you have a story? 
 It's gotta be the pattern, though; normally I knit large and this? Too small. The first thing I've knit too small in, oh, six years? ;)
 Maaan. I hate it when I swatch, get gauge, and the project STILL turns out unnervingly not the right size.
  Non-poopy cars: also a good idea. ;)
  You're welcome twice. ;D
 Sooo tired. But knitting beaded lace socks anyway. Must finish. Must. Finish...
  That would be AWESOME. I would so read a webcomic about guinea hens.
 RT  Give  an awesome birthday gift by buying some of her incredible hand spun yarn! 
  Oh, happy birthday early! ;D (Just in case I'm not around.)
 Doing a little bit at a time, today...
 Does anyone use Spoonflower? What do you do with your fabric?
  And those would be some badass guinea fowl. You could write a webcomic about their adventures. ;)
  I say this because the squirrels around here are way more of a garden pest than snakes. ;) Bugs — we have enough to share.
  Awww ... Not really a fan of the "eating snakes" part, but they can have my squirrels instead if they like. ;)
 Whoa, missing apostrophe alert!
  With you! I loves me some guineas. They make funny noises & look like spotty beach balls when they sit. Whats not to love?
 Wow, thanks for the  love,    :D
 Finally finished knitting that Wisp I started in December. :D Need to block it still...
 Just cut up a t-shirt to use as hankies. Now waiting eagerly for the urge to sneeze again. Ha...
  Oh, well. Guess I'll count it as a serenade while I make dinner. ;) Which I shall go and do now. I think.
  Ha, ha ... Your secret weapon: noise-cancelling headphones. Or maybe ear plugs.
  You could try J-Pop, too. ;D Bonus points for potential incomprehensibility!
  Yeah, I always want to blast Beethoven or Star Wars music or Cats or something. ;)
  To be fair, the noise still isn't as loud. I think they had their speakers directly on the floor before. Snort.
  We get the stairs stuff, too — two big college guys living above us. Too bad they're not in training to be ninjas. ;)
  O man. I shouldn't have said anything about the upstairs noise being mysteriously gone. Because of course now it's back ... ;)
  Glad to help, then! :D Always nice to hear my babbling serves some useful purpose in the world. ;)
  Hey, thanks for the RT! ;D
 A dark fibery secret: The way stray bits of limp wet wool stick to my fingers when I'm washing fleece is pretty annoying to me. ;)
  Ha, ha — I know *exactly* what you mean. Most of my goals are pipe dreams at the moment.
 Washing some mystery wool fleece from an unlabeled part of my stash. Erk. Note to self: label more consistently.
 Whoa. Silkworms that spin colored silk:   
 Blogged about creativity vs. destruction & tiny crocheted tawashi:  
 Must go now and be crafty. I command thee, Self! ;)
  Yeah ... It's much funnier now that that and the obscenely loud music don't happen every other day. Whew. ;)
  Ha, ha — yeah, we had giant steel drums being used as portable furniture a couple months ago.
  At least figuring out what the heck could make some of those noises was like playing detective. ;)
  I know exactly what you mean re: mind-boggling noise. Luckily my neighbors have gotten mysteriously quiet lately...
 In this week's  post, I talk about doing a teeny bit more than I did before:   What'd you craft this week?
 So now that I have conferred with  we are happy to announce that the giveaway winner is Silvina Leonnetti! Woohoo!
 Just DMed  with the winner of the giveaway. ;D Announcement Very Soon!
  It's tiiiime to draw the winner of the giveaway! ;D Gonna go look at the spreadsheet and generate a random number!
 Ha, ha — am using the exact time from  to time the drawing of a winner in the giveaway with  
 I think I'll do a study of disagreeable behavior on Ravelry's Random Acts of Kindness forum. Disagreeable RAKers seem a bit contradictory.
  Thankee, as always, for the RT. ;D And now back to poking at last-second giveaway wrap-up stuffs!
 < 2 hrs till  and I get to see who wins the mini shawl pin + hand-sewn pouch. ;D You can still enter: 
 RT  I love how fashion can make a person feel wearing/looking at it, I hate how it often make… (cont) 
 (And as a bonus, there's a cute idea with the story for how to creatively upcycle odds and ends that some people would throw out. :))
 I like this little story of someone who defied a discouraging teacher — even though it was later in life:  
 I love mini paper punches. Forgot how much until I found my Teeny Tiny Cassette Punch. Tiny paper confetti things!! ;)
  If only there were less of a dearth of table in this house. ;) I could piece something together anyway. Or make scrappy napkins.
  What about one of those exercisey Babe spinning wheels instead? ;D Exercise AND fiber!
 A treasury telling a story of springtime weather:   & a painting that eerily matches the colors of my yarn! 
  The name is now enshrined on a sideways purple sticky note attached to my desktop's monitor. Poof!
  Ha, ha ... I need to write that name down. It seems pretty perfect. Seventies crap loom, TRANSFORM! Into less crap loom!
 Now I'm sure this is the reason I wanted a serger: super-stretchy seams on knits! Woooo!
  Pinoloomio almost sounds like a weird weaving product — ha! ;D Which I guess it kind of would be...
  Maybe I'll name it Pinocchio. Loomocchio?
  I want to trick it out — put heddle blocks on, replace bolts with screws, paint it. Make it a Real Loom.
  Ha, ha! Maybe we did have the same first non-plastic loom experience! ;) Mine was one of those seventies hobby looms.
 Need to go make something. But what?
  Woo, thanks for the RT! ;D
  My first non-plastic loom was so crappy that I thought *I* sucked at weaving for a long time. 
  Your crappy loaner loom has got to be better than my crappy first loom, right? It doesn't fall apart while weaving? ;)
  Yeah, it works amazingly well for that. If I had more pocket money it'd be in danger. ;)
 I admit it: I like that I can see in Etsy circles when my items get hearts or are in treasuries. I've found tons of new shops that way, too.
 Er, I meant super-easy projectS. You know, that plural thing. ;)
 I need suggestions for super-easy project to practice using my serger on. Completely-serger seamed projects would be cool. :D
 And I thought my sewing machine was loud. Are all sergers this loud?
 Anyone know of any Japan relief efforts yet in the crafting world?
  Hey, thanks a ton! ;D
  As always, madam, you rocketh. ;)
 Thanks to      for  mentions! ;D
 Just listed a bunch of handspun in the shop, woohoo! My favorite is rainbow organic wool: 
 Finished weaving the scarf that was on the Cricket. :D Man, it's all soft and drapey — good thing I can't keep it 'cause I used angora. ;)
 Must stop meandering around online and go do crafty stuffs. *drags self away*
  Like light speed. ;D
  Dood. That was fast. *unspecific reference to Etsy circles*
  Do the giveaway dance, doo doo doo doo ... *dance*
  I just discovered, though, that I can make e-mail visible in my Blogger profile from the profile itself. Tricksy. ;)
  Did you want e-mail enabled for the Blogger profile or the Google one? The Dashboard, etc., path takes me to my Google profile.
  Ha, ha ... See, you have that covered and I've got Ravelry, so it works! Woo!
  Coo! I putzed around in Blogger prefs for a little bit, but wasn't sure what exactly to turn on, so help would be super. :D
  Awesome. :D Glad to know people are still finding the giveaway!
  Welcome! :D & maybe you could point us clueless types toward how to enable e-mail, since off the top of my head? No idea. ;)
  We're south of Destin, but it's nice and cool without being actually chilly. Sun came out, too. Last night: thunder + rain.
  The fact that we live in Florida and wool is rarely used makes it slightly more tragic, too. Sniffle.
  It was totally an accident, but that doesn't make it safe to gift him with further non-machine-washable goodies. ;)
  A kind captain? Maybe ... or maybe just a primarily solutions-oriented one. ;)
  I consider the emotional pain he inflicts on himself for his sloppiness a fair enough punishment. ;)
  He hasn't discovered it yet; it was sticking out of the laundry pile. He'll probably be devastated when he finds out, but still.
 Groan. The first mate machine-washed a handspun, handwoven scarf I made him. Last year's casualty: a pair of socks. He's officially cut off.
  Yeah, I know what you mean. I was so there until I got this one for my birthday. (WHEW.)
 Dear camera: Hugs and kudos. You are the savior of my product photography.
  I think I will! Thanks for the vote in favor! ;D
 I love this tatted atom pendant:  Yay, geeky sciencey fibercraft!
 I made a sewing machine cover. *beam* Only took me ten years or so. 
 Off I go to browse some of my books with quick sewing projects in them ... before I psych myself out or get derailed! ;D
  I've had some that was meltingly soft — seriously like butter. Wonder how that would work out for you...
  Ohhh, yeah. I don't much like the guard hairs, either. I like obscenely non-guard-hairy llama and alpaca.
 *mumbles something about boxes of alpaca and llama fleeces waiting to be used*
  Oh, wow. I haven't heard of a camelid allergy before — but it had to happen to someone. Alas! I loves me some alpaca.
 Sewed a little funky spiral to see if the machine is running smoothly. Tentatively: It works. For now. ;) Now: Need a small sewing project.
  Just allergic to angora. I was hoping the tiny proportion would make it okay, but no dice! Any angora = itchy. Oh, well.
 Back to poking at the sewing machine! I'm obsessively following the manual after years of not. Just to see if it makes a difference.
  So tomorrow There Shall Be Pics Taken. And I can't keep this friggin' angora/silk recycled yarn shawl, either. 
  Love that lemony yarn you listed not too long ago. It is SO lemonade. ;)
  If I like them enough to want to keep them, someone else will probably like them, too, right? ;)
  They're all singles, not like the stuff I have listed already, but I think I'll list them anyway. ;D
  .... and create the Ultimate Bacon Super-Product, to Destroy the Universe!! Or something like that. ;)
  What? Better than bacon mints or bacon ice cream? ;)
 There's a bunch of handspun yarn in the craft show inventory that never made it into the Etsy shop. Should I list it or use it? Hmm...
 Who out there wears head scarves, and why? I like to wear triangle ones to keep my hair out of my face while cleaning. Woo, Cinderella. ;)
 Just bought some old seventies crochet booklets, including one with hairpin lace in it. Woohoo. $3 destash FTW.
 Cool — a guinea feather necklace! Guineas: the birds that look like flattened beach balls when sitting. 
  Party in the house! Crafts for everyone this month! Or something.
 Oh, it's National Craft Month. Anyone doing anything awesome for it?
 My first piece of mail art to go out into the world in years is now in an envie and ready to mail. *anticipation*
 Catching up with new follower notifications now ... I've been a bad girl. A fairly decent pirate, though.
 Oh, and if you missed it, the giveaway for a mini star shawl pin + a hand-sewn pouch from  is still open! 
  Love the name "Princess Sparkle Pony." Ha. Makes me want my Fashion Star FIllies & My Little Ponies back.
 Play "spot the Star Wars reference" + help me figure out what these mystery scissors are for:  
 I should totally credit that link to Debby, but I suddenly can't remember what her Twitter name is. 
 Coming to you from your neighborhood fiber pirate: A horse named Arrrrr, and an announcer who loves it: 
  You're very welcome. ;D
  Your cute knits are also appreciated. ;) Looking forward to the next.
  My vote is for a knit dinosaur or UFO!
 Just came across this glass spinning wheel again. If you haven't seen it, you should. A spinning wheel. Made of glass. 
 I may actually be in the mood for knitting again soon. Bet my hands will think it's weird after a month not knitting. ;)
 Happy end of  I have five empty bobbins + one full, which is good 'cause that's only one bobbin at risk of abandonment. ;)
 I'm not sure whether I'm going to finish my final skein of yarn for the  today. MEH. Send poking vibes if you got 'em.
 So far I am kicking the butt of me-of-last-year at the  Yeah. Woo. Ha. Coo. I have seven skeins finished already!
  Ha, ha ... I'm here and then GONE! ;) But it's nice to be seen, and to see others, like you & your friendly face. ;D
 Has anyone ever done knotted-pile weaving? I'm trying to figure out how to try it on my rigid heddle.
 I am such a bad pirate. Or maybe a good pirate but a bad user of social media. But I promise I'm still alive, O lovers of yarn and crafts!
  DOH. I totally forgot to join Team Social. I am so smrt. Well, I posted on that thread, anyway. ;D Thanks for linkage!
 There are sure a lot of trindles on the  daily progress threads. Nooooooo! Do not tempt me, trindle owners!
  agree(1) Eating ice cream sounds like a good way to celebrate TdF day 1. And is there really a  ;D
 Almost done spinning my 2 oz of Juniper-colored Louet top. Note to self: More gets done when you spin whimsically. 
 Sometimes I think there needs to be a "Wow" button to click on Ravelry. (And a "thanks" button would be nice, too.)
 Day 1 of the  is going pretty well so far. :D Spun an ounce of yarn this morning:  
 Oo, just found  tips on sewing with handwovens. Awesome. Maybe they'll help me be brave enough to try: 
 Thank you, Tour de Fleece planning, for giving me a use for basic algebra. I still need to figure out how to use sines and cosines, though.
 I have a whole bunch of Trellis ribbon yarn and I have no idea what I want to do with it. Eep.
 Holy crappity, the Tour de Fleece is in just a few days. I really did drop off the planet for a few weeks! ;)
 Oh, lace scarf, you've fought me from the start. Even on the blocking board I find something to fix ... sigh. Well, soon it'll be done. ;)
 Uh-oh, time for the Interweave Hurt Book Sale! Gotta find some extra money for craft books now ... ;)
 Also, in case anyone was wondering: Blocking mats are the opposite of resistant to cat claws.
 WHEW. I swear there are more pins in that little rectangular slip of lace than I needed to make a big cartridge-pleated costume skirt.
  Oooops! Super-belatedly, I know solar dyeing works here, so I bet setting TeeJuice in a hot car is a fair shot ... ;)
 Knit lace rectangle to me: Oh, you thought blocking was easy? Hahahahahahaha...
 Did some craft room reorganizing today ... woo. It's now in that lovely "looks worse than when I started" stage. ;)
 I now have a fabric steamer. Er. Is there something I can do with this aside from steaming clothes, drapes, and maybe yarn? ;)
  The sticking toschedule part is where that plan falls apart for me, too. ;) Someday I'll come up with a clever fun way to do it!
 And now, back to working on the endless scarf ... or maybe to read for a little bit, and THEN work on the scarf.
  Saaaame here. This lack of weekend-feeling is something I suspect I can remedy, someday, with some tricky scheduling, though. ;D
 RT  Ahh, Sunday morning. Which is like any other morning, really. Sometimes I miss that special fe… (cont) 
 Also, weird fact of the day: I am currently knitting two unrelated bright yellow lace objects with flower themes as gifts for different ppl.
 And the usual round of sincere thanks to  for the  mention. :D
 Working on my endless recycled yarn lace scarf. Why did I think I could finish this in a couple of weeks, again? ;)
  Moose hair? ;) (For a second there I thought you had ordered a moose. Ha.)
 Wondering who wrote this caption in Vogue Knitting; whoever it is seems to think kimonos are ... severe? Not a word I would have used. ;)
 Mehhh. Need to work on a project, but it's turned into kind of a tedious slog. If it were for me I think I would be closer to frogging it...
 Officially calling it: I will never see the end of my Ravelry knitting queue. (Well, unless I go to the final page, but you know. ;))
 DUDE. This Spock Hat *with ears* is hilarious and awesome:   
 Recycled a commercial cotton sweater into yarn. Looks like there's more than enough to make the cardigan I was looking at — woo!
 Oh, and a belated  thanks to  ;) Appreciation, appreciation!
  I liked your egg, but I like your fibery goodness better. ;D
 For some reason I keep wanting to try free-form knitting, like on freeform knit 365:   Anyone else do it? :D
  Hahaha! According to Twitter I'm your personal account's first follower! I win! ;)
 Oops. Did I forget to link to my latest blog post with pics of proof I've actually been finishing things lately? ;) 
  I'm either psychic ... or you mentioned it in your previous tweet, one or the other. ;)
  Cool! Thanks for the tips on Finn. That saves me the trouble of trying the Louet stuff and getting put off. ;D
  No, I loooooove BFL for spinning, too. ;D Enough that I want to make sure I don't get stuck there and not explore anything else.
  Yeah, wool + alpaca is an awesome combo. :D
  Any recommendations on good sources of Finn? :D
 Hey, spinners and other fibery people! What's your favorite fine wool? :D
 I want to knit something new, but I don't know what. 
 The cats have indeed been walking on my shawl as it blocks, and trying to steal the blocking mats. Foolish, foolish kitties.
  (And okay, my own mild incompetence and lack of attention-paying strikes again. ;))
  DUDE. That last tweet should have been from here. TweetDeck strikes again. ;)
 Dry, shawl, dry! Dry, shawl, dry! Not that I can wear you around the house in the 85-degree weather, but I can sneak a try.
  Oops, belated reply time! Your secret's safe with me (and I hope with Twitter)! Is your singles still on the bobbin? ;D
 Hmm. If I bought another set of interlocking blocking mats I think I could block anything short of a blanket...
 First time blocking a lace shawl today. Whew. I now cross fingers that no cats will take a fancy to it while it is thus vulnerable.
 Navajo-plying some singles from (shhh) last year. Gotta clear off the bobbins before the Tour de Fleece.
  Love your latest Twitter icon! ;D (I'm probably super-belated on that...)
 Apparently you can use a pasta machine to take the seeds out of cotton bolls. Cool. ;D YouTube video (not mine): 
 Dude, the printer needs another new ink cartridge. Second time this week. That's what I get for not buying the whole set at once. ;)
 I should so not be allowed to knit lace without lifelines. Sigh.
 The little tags I just hand-sewed onto this floofy knit scarf remind me of little quilted patches. Ha.
 I have a sense that my old-school geeky live chat self may live again on Ravelry soon. Yeah. Trolling for chat rooms that are open...
 Ha! I just discovered that Ravelry forums with chats running Right Now have a little speech bubble by them. That is the Coolest Thing Evar.
 Ever have one of those days where you can't seem to do usual things quite right? Yeah, having one of those. Sigh.
 Rearranged some of my old scrapbooking supplies. It's amazing how much more fun playing with paper is when you can actually get to it. ;)
 Thankee to the darling  &  for your  mentions. ;D
 Or maybe the yarn is holding like half an ounce of humidity. That would be, errr ... annoying, to say the least. ;)
 I feel like I'm going to get to the middle and the last two yards are going to weigh half an ounce by themselves. ;)
 This is the weirdest ball of yarn ever. It's like an inch smaller in diameter than it was, but it only weighs 0.2 oz less than it did.
  I'm usually like "Oh, cute!" when I see moths outside, but inside, I start to feel a little murderous. ;)
 You know you're a fiber person when small moths indoors make you nervous. No matter what they look like.
 Also: While I do indeed wish to knit more shawls, I need to stop finding awesome knitalongs. I do not have time for all this KAL! 
 Finally starting Chart B of my Traveling Woman shawl. FI. NAL. LY.
 I need a crafty time-out from my most recent active projects. But at the same time I want to finish them, THEN take a break. Hrmph.
 Knitting this huge pink scarf is making me want a big chunky knit blanket in BFL wool. I wonder how many pounds of wool that'd take...
  I have a semi-opposite problem — I am apron-resistant, but after baking & subsequently knitting, I think I need one...
  Tres ridiculous! ;) I made my sister an "I Love Lucy"-style apron last year. From a kit bcs I = lazy sometimes.
 80% done with the gigantic pink scarf. The end is in sight! Then I get to wash a pound of wool scarf.
 For some reason it's been really hard to convince myself to knit today. I may be a tad burned out. Oh, well, gotta do what I gotta do. ;)
  This one?  There are a few results for "tulip" and "tulips" amongst the cardigans ... ;)
  Tulip Cardi? Will check it out! Thanks! :D
 Poking about on Ravelry for small, cute-but-not-cutesy cardigan patterns for a fall cardi KAL.
 So ready to take a little break from thinking about fiber right now. A cup of tea, a little light reading — then back to knitting.
  Aww, thanks for the RT! *wavewave* You, as always, are awesome. ;D
 Yay! The story of a skein of yarn, from fleece to fiber art, with lots of pictures:  
  Dude, I thought you meant spotted dog like the pudding, for a second there. ;)
 Thanks for the  love to  and  ;D
 Anyone know what SNDR stands for when it's in front of an alpaca's name?
 That alpaca fiber turned into art yarn, semisolid & thread-plied ... a far cry from the traditional 2-ply I thought it'd be. ;)
  Oh, are you using a pattern for the cardi or making up your own? Just wondering what pattern! ;D
 Taking a break from fiber prep, then once more unto the breach of spinning this alpaca!
 One reason spinning samples before starting a project is good: Sometimes the fiber REALLY doesn't want to be what you want it to be. ;)
 Dude, I forgot how long it takes me to spin laceweight. Especially this stuff. Grumble grumble.
 Hey, hand carders. Let's go bother some alpaca fleece, shall we?
  LOL — no, eye tooth awareness is a sign of wisdom, not old age! ;)
 Behold! Photos of the finally-finished Epic Socks AND of the huge pink scarf that's breaking the sound barrier: 
  And hey, that takes the effort out of deciding on pricing! *writes down* One bottle of obsessive finishing for one eye tooth. ;)
 So. I wonder how fast I can conceivably expect 4 oz or so of raw alpaca fiber to dry with a fan pointed right at it. GO FIBER GO!
  And awww! If I were a blushing gal I'd blush. Happy to assist with the quest for fun. ;)
  I should figure out how to bottle and sell it, huh? ;D
 (It appears that my UFObusting instinct is rearing its head.)
 I have this slightly mad urge to pick a knitting UFO and keep knitting until I either finish it or fall asleep on top of it.
 (By which I am incompetently attempting to imply that fiber crap is keeping me from sleeping like a reasonable person. ;))
 I am the Unsleeping Pirate! I wish the fiber in the Crock Pot would cool down fast all by itself. ;)
 Thank goodness I have a working fan now. It makes it so much more convenient to hand-wash stuff when it actually dries in a day or two. ;)
 Going to move from the computer desk to the futon ... This project is getting too large for just my lap to handle. ;)
 Dude, I just realized I typed "every sock leg" when I meant "every sock foot."  
   agree(1)! And nighty night. ;D
   Ha, ha! *That's* why I keep missing all the fun! 
   ... until suddenly the toe decreases are upon me and I'm paranoid I've knit too long. ;)
   Though "I keep knitting but it doesn't get any longer" sounds like every sock leg I've knit...
   a) Knitting a black hole is oddly appealing. b) Putting  in geo… (cont) 
 I swear this yarn with these needles knits up at two rows per inch. 
  And in black yarn it'd feel like two lifetimes. I'd need two lifetimes' worth of eyes, too. 
  Holy crappity, I don't even want to think about how long it'd take to knit 72 inches of 12-inch-wide scarf on tiny needles...
  Big needles it is! Though big needles or no, it'll still take me a while to knit 72 inches of scarf. ;)
 Maybe both, in succession...?
 Next question: Knit giant pink yarn on big needles, or skinny black yarn on tiny needles? Hrrmmmm...
 Went with turquoise with a sprinkle of sky blue and yellow. Now, cross fingers, turn on Crock Pot, and wait.
  Your outing gives me comfort.  ;)
  There was a TV news spot on it, IIRC. I was pretty impressed; they seemed very polite. Not that I know lots of rude camelids. ;)
 Must avoid dyeing said alpaca all of the above, since this yarn is not going to be for me, but for a mostly unknown quantity. ;)
 Now to decide what color to dye this alpaca. Blue, green or purple were the suggestions ... and I have all of the above. Eep.
  Like the ones I saw once that lived in someone's house. Or was that llamas? It was a while ago so I don't remember.
  Ha, ha ... A prim and proper alpaca. Maybe one who wants his or her nails clipped and wears a bow or a bowtie.
  I could definitely use a few more OCD sheep fleeces, though, ha. ;D
  It's actually alpaca, which kinda makes it weirder, since they supposedly like rolling in dust, you know?
 Maybe I bought a washed alpaca fleece without realizing it. That'd be pretty funny. ;)
 I think this is the cleanest fleece I have ever washed. Ever. There's ... like ... not even dust in it. 
  Awesome. ;D Looking forward to seeing what comes of all the sparklethoughts.
  And if it counts for anything, I would totally knit a sparkly shawl out of sock weight yarn.
  And I think something in this color:  would be super awesome with sparkle. ;D
  I think it'd work, personally. The sparkly sock yarn I reference was a fairly bright turquoise and I still think it's lovely. ;D
  Some of the first sock yarn I ever bought was sparkly, and one of the first shawls I made was sparkly, too! ;D
  I would LOVE sparkly sock yarn and lace yarn. Love love love.
 Er, put them off TILL tomorrow. Proofreading fail.
 I should not be a slacker and put off the washing and dyeing tomorrow. I laugh in the face of midnight! Wahahaha!
 I keep getting totally derailed from washing some raw alpaca fleece I meant to have dyed by now. DOH. 
 Because steampunk is already historically inaccurate, and the patterns aren't for painful movie knockoffs. Yay! ;)
 Although the Simplicity costume patterns have often given me miniature heart attacks, I give their steampunk collection a thumbs up.
 The  mystery poster will have pirates, bacon AND a sheep shooting eye-lasers. How could I not pre-order one? ;) 
 Hmm ... Sock-knitting may be in my immediate future. Ta for now, mates.
  My mom is Chinese born in Indonesia, but she speaks Dutch, because — well, you know!
  Bacon bot! As far as bots go, that doesn't sound half bad.
  Hey, cool, my mom is from Indonesia. ;D Not that that's at all relevant, but the vague connection is kind of entertaining.
  But bacon and knitting make a good garnish? ;D
  Which part, the megapink yarn? ;D
  DOH. I should have mentioned it before: There's a 10¢ deal for it at Interweave right now: 
 My life lately: spinning a pound of BFL, knitting a handspun shawl, and finishing those beaded lace socks.  
  Re: Respect the Spindle, I haven't actually seen the book, so I can't compare. The vid was 10¢ so I had to check it out. ;)
  Belated response time! My day was absorbed by big fat pink BFL yarn. ;)
 Watching the Respect the Spindle video is tweaking my spindle-buying urge. I want a Bosworth, or a Golding, or ... or ... ;)
  What kind of fiber are/were you spinning, anyway?
  Is that your shirt showing in the next shot? ;) I like it!
 Yeah, action shot, woo! ;D // RT   Using one of your spindles today.  
  Delayed reaction from yesterday: DUDE. COOL! ;D I hardly ever get to see action shots!
 Possibly today is the first time I've ever made two separate batches of the same recipe in one day ... ;)
   Thanks! ;D I'm going to count it as a bonus if I manage to cast on the second of the pair tonight...
 Wahaha! I finished a sock. Only took me mumblemumble months. *snort* Including knitting almost a whole sock at the wrong gauge...
 Look! Socks on the beach & frilly things on my blog!  
 Still need to figure out what crochet project to do next, though. Suggestions are welcome. ;D
 Package in the mail, dyed fiber drying, undyed fiber soaking in prep for being dyed. Now there's an unborn sock toe with my name on it.
 Plan for the rest of the day: Weigh fiber, play with wire and hammer, activate Dyepot of Doom, knit a sock toe.
 Whew. What a week last week was. What have I missed? ;)
 Do I knit before heading off to a housewarming party? Yeah, I guess I do. Lace socks, get ready.
 In need of tea. I spy a brass tea kettle that warrants attention.
  OMG. I have always wanted a hammock. Someday I too will have one. Maybe I will MAKE one. ;)
 I went picture-crazy in my latest blog post. Want to see my newest sharp objects & haphazard baking?  
  Hmm, iced tea and rum sounds doable ... If I have any pirate parties this summer I should try it. ;D
  I think I need much stronger tea for a rum + tea combo ... ;)
 Grumpy pirate alert! Going to go see if a nice cup of tea will soothe the savage sailor-type-person. ;)
 is now the proud owner of two rotary cutters, thanks to a kindly gift card. Woo.
 It's my craft blog's blogiversary! Yayyy, I remembered in time! ;) To celebrate, yarny pics & a coupon code:  
 RT  Needle-felting is great for venting frustration when you're feeling kind of stabby...  
 (...and probably, eating something would restore some of my command of language and concepts ... ;))
 Anyway, while I'm waiting on cowly thoughts, I think I will go and knit lacy socks. Must defeat the massive knit-UFO horde!
   Oh, and I mean visibly heavier on the pseudo than the vintage inspiration & creativity. Need better words. ;)
   But when something is PSEUDO-vintage there's about a 50% chance I'll hate it ... or LOVE it. ;)
   Yeah, my resistance to bandwagon lowers as the trend gets closer to actually vintage.
   The client is now mulling over cowls. Thanks for the ideas — without my tweeps I wouldn't even have asked. ;)
   Sometimes I start to even feel twinges of bandwagon allergy when it comes to fiber arts. Very un-useful. ;)
   I was beat over the head with cowl patterns while Rav searching for chunky yarn/low yardage patterns. ;)
   I've been kind of waffly about cowls — I've always liked them but sometimes I have a bandwagon allergy.
  Pretty sure there will be pics on the blog once it's done. Of the entire process. ;) I've been slacky about posting them...
   Maybe I'll ask about the cowl thing anyway. He's been pretty specific, but you never know...
  Gonna make a whole 'nother batch of yarn. The nitpicker in me can't find any way out of it (and it's been trying). ;)
 OMG a spurtle! I totally want one of these.  I have a cookbook that mentions them and I would sooooo use it.
 Time to buy more fiber! Ha...
  If it were for me, I probably would, but it's a custom order and he specifically wants gigantofat yarn, soooo ... ;)
  I console myself with the fact that aside from my estimate of how much wool it'd take, my math & spinning were right on. ;)
  A giant fat poofy scarf! Of course, I need about twice as much yarn as I currently have to make the size I want. 
 Takin' my size 13 needles and hangin' out with some fat pink yarn. Yeah. Woo.
 Pretty sure this pink three-ply is the fattest yarn I've spun to date ... At the very least the center-pull balls are giganto.
  Ha ... No, I'd think it would tell you to do a provisional CO if it meant that. ;) But I wanted to ask just in case...
 Man, I need a brain tune-up. Or a vacation. Or maybe that's redundant. ;)
  Anyway, I totally need to try provisional CO + circs someday. Curious: Did your pattern say to undo the long-tail sts?
  So then I got to fudge around with eight dpns to get the two sets of stitches to line up parallel. ;)
  Doh. I wasn't being very clear: I meant the pattern said to move the CO sts onto dpns BEFORE bringing CO edge to live sts.
  And it seemed like it'd have been easier to bring the CO edge to the live stitches if both were on circs rather than dpns...
  To bring the CO edge behind the live stitches, that is. Bcs that was the order in which the pattern said to do it.
  that really got me the first time was trying to use two sets of dpns at once and manipulate them through each other. ;)
  No worries. ;D The pattern I'm using left me a choice of provisional COs, so I did a crochet one, with dpns. The thing
  Made it less rage-inducing. ;) Possibly hemmed cuffs are easier if you use circular needles...
  The second time I did it, I only transferred the cast-on sts to the dpn that I was going to be using immediately.
  Well, good. ;D I'm inching, too, though not quite as well as you are, I think. ;)
 Now I need to find some fiber I only have about an ounce of, that would make good lace. Off to shop the stash...
 Hahaha! Evil beaded hemmed cuff, I have VANQUISHED you!
  See, if it's figurative then I have to ask what you mean by it. So what not-physical places are you going? ;D
  Took almost the same amount of time, but I wanted to murder the first one. This one not so much.
  Mine is a hemmed cuff, too! These things take SO. LONG. It's my second one ever. Went better than the first one. ;)
  Going places sounds like fun. Literally going places, or figuratively? ;)
  Halloooo! How's things? One more dpn to go for this sock cuff of doom...
 Oy. This is the Sock Cuff of Forever-Taking.
 Woo. 240ish yards of Navajo-plied socky-weight yarn. One more bobbin to go, but I don't think I'm going to get to it tonight...
 Having a fractious day. Maybe Navajo plying will get the randomness out of my system.
 Also avoiding re-swatching for a project I may have to frog entirely. Grumble grumble. But a knitter's gotta do what a knitter's gotta do.
 Going through knitting needles, organizing projects. Winter cleaning has officially turned into spring cleaning. ;)
 Whew. Taking self-portraits is hard work. Dern bio pics. No one needs to know what I really look like, right? ;)
 Ha! Love this blog post from   Makes me feel better about the cost of craft supplies. ;)
 There are like two million loose ends hanging over me right now, oysh. Going to go try to spin my way through one of them!
  It's funny how I took the project on as a challenge, but I was actually defeated by bad writing, not difficult knitting. ;)
 (The pattern is attached to a UFO that's *ahem* several years old. It put me off socks for a long time, honestly.)
 I promise I gave it a good try. I just thought *I* sucked & socks were Really Hard. Now that I've knit more, I realize it was the pattern.
 Not naming names, but dude. This pattern is so badly-written that to finish knitting it, I am going to have to rewrite it for myself.
 I printed little mini cards with yarn on them! I feel strangely competent. Except for the fact that my trim marks were useless ... ;)
 Off to play with Illustrator. Working on some yarn-related arty stuff. ;D
 Hrrmm. What kind of tea goes with pouring rain?
  Sometimes I actually enjoy it, but a lot of times I need to do it when I just don't feel like it. ;)
  They're all I have, I swear. ;) Though now that I have a better lighting situation I should stop whinging and take pics.
  I've been maundering to myself about whether I want to add a crocheted or knit edging, as my excuse for not photographing it. ;)
  Meh, you can kind of see it here:  and here:  but clearly those are not OF the shawl. ;)
  Somewhere, there's a photo of it being used as a display at a craft event ... Lemme see if I can find it...
  Which is kind of funny, since I have a handwoven cream-colored shawl sitting around waiting to be photographed. Snortle.
 O man, I just had a random shawl pin idea. The toolbox is sucking me toward it like a rare earth magnet...
  Thankee most kindly for your RT! :D
 I've been wanting to make a rainbow shawl pin for a while, and I finally did. Woo! ;D   
 Dark and cloudy here, for four in the afternoon. Guess it's going to storm!
 I hope the rest of this ridiculously-colorful-in-a-good-way treasury on  is also craftily contagious: 
 Oops, lost a space in there. *hangs head*
 Thiscolorful free-form crochet shawl makes me want to pick up the crochet hook again. Awesome crafting is contagious. 
 My wheelspun yarn is so not the same as my spindle-spun yarn...
  is making me want to break out my spindle again. It's stuck with some superfine thready turquoise yarn on it ATM. *shame*
  You're welcome. May it serve you well and provide much easy nom. ;)
  There you go, super-easy drop scones on the griddle recipe in your inbox. Woo.
  Actually, I'll send you the recipe. Ha. ;) It'll be my excuse to answer an e-mail from you from long ago.
  They're not just like the baked kind of scones — more like pancakes — but they're better cold than any pancakes I've ever had.
  I send drop-sconey vibes to you! Though they were actually super-easy, which is why I made them. One bowl + a frying pan.
  About the same here, though it's been lots of tea and drop scones instead of muffins, heavy on the work vs. the relaxation. ;D
 Off to go play with tools and wire. (Meaning it's shawl-pin-making time!)
 ...or maybe I'm really just trying to figure out what my shawl pin symbolizes as part of the significant course of one person's life. ;D
 My newest shawl pin is in a treasury called "My life in one day" — a mysterious name I don't know the story behind ... 
 Looking at the Ravatars for ppl who have favorited the Heel Flap Scarf is like looking at friendly faces. ;D The scarf: 
 OMG, I put up my  check-in for this week before noon. Still going slowly:  
 I wonder if trying t-shirt recon tutorials on about three hours of sleep is a good idea or a bad one. Hmmmm. ;)
  Apparently I can't even keep my mind on Twitter today ... ;) Something must be hiding in my brain and taking up all my resources!
  They're definitely an interesting concept. Hrrmmm. Trying to figure out where they fit into my online info consumption habit. ;)
  It does sound cool! ;D Do people really read them?
  Ooh, it's me! Thanks! ;) What *is* that daily thingie about, anyway? My lack of cool is showing — I don't really get it ... ;)
 And a predictably late but still heartfelt thanks to  for the steadfast  love!
 Got one lone new shawl pin listed in the shop today, ruby red:   
 Working on shawl pins & new designs all day makes a fiber pirate tired. Still have to knit, though. Gotta earn my Aubrey and Maturin.
 Just joined the  team. Woohoo! Does that mean I get a Real Weaver card now? ;)
 Strangely tired ... but I still have knitting to do. Yawns, tea and tiny knitting needles ahead for me...
  Thanks! ;D I should probably stop compulsively checking the downloads page now, though ... ha...
 Baffled by the  of downloads of the new scarf pattern today. That many people now have my PDF. On their computers. 
 I really want to make t-shirt yarn. Tried once, but my choice of t-shirts was flawed ... It was old enough to crumble at the edges. 
 Yayyy! My new  pattern is up on  It's a ribby-textured skinny scarf — and it's free! ;D 
 New knitting pattern in layout — finally. Need to proof it and then maybe, maybe it will show up on Ravelry today. ;D
 Anyone remember the early 70s and know what a "shrink top" is?
 Oh, noooo, the washer/dryer needs service. Crap on a stick.
 It's World Storytelling Day! So I talk about stories for  today:  Do you have a story? 
 It's gotta be the pattern, though; normally I knit large and this? Too small. The first thing I've knit too small in, oh, six years? ;)
 Maaan. I hate it when I swatch, get gauge, and the project STILL turns out unnervingly not the right size.
  Non-poopy cars: also a good idea. ;)
  You're welcome twice. ;D
 Sooo tired. But knitting beaded lace socks anyway. Must finish. Must. Finish...
  That would be AWESOME. I would so read a webcomic about guinea hens.
 RT  Give  an awesome birthday gift by buying some of her incredible hand spun yarn! 
  Oh, happy birthday early! ;D (Just in case I'm not around.)
 Doing a little bit at a time, today...
 Does anyone use Spoonflower? What do you do with your fabric?
  And those would be some badass guinea fowl. You could write a webcomic about their adventures. ;)
  I say this because the squirrels around here are way more of a garden pest than snakes. ;) Bugs — we have enough to share.
  Awww ... Not really a fan of the "eating snakes" part, but they can have my squirrels instead if they like. ;)
 Whoa, missing apostrophe alert!
  With you! I loves me some guineas. They make funny noises & look like spotty beach balls when they sit. Whats not to love?
 Wow, thanks for the  love,    :D
 Finally finished knitting that Wisp I started in December. :D Need to block it still...
 Just cut up a t-shirt to use as hankies. Now waiting eagerly for the urge to sneeze again. Ha...
  Oh, well. Guess I'll count it as a serenade while I make dinner. ;) Which I shall go and do now. I think.
  Ha, ha ... Your secret weapon: noise-cancelling headphones. Or maybe ear plugs.
  You could try J-Pop, too. ;D Bonus points for potential incomprehensibility!
  Yeah, I always want to blast Beethoven or Star Wars music or Cats or something. ;)
  To be fair, the noise still isn't as loud. I think they had their speakers directly on the floor before. Snort.
  We get the stairs stuff, too — two big college guys living above us. Too bad they're not in training to be ninjas. ;)
  O man. I shouldn't have said anything about the upstairs noise being mysteriously gone. Because of course now it's back ... ;)
  Glad to help, then! :D Always nice to hear my babbling serves some useful purpose in the world. ;)
  Hey, thanks for the RT! ;D
 A dark fibery secret: The way stray bits of limp wet wool stick to my fingers when I'm washing fleece is pretty annoying to me. ;)
  Ha, ha — I know *exactly* what you mean. Most of my goals are pipe dreams at the moment.
 Washing some mystery wool fleece from an unlabeled part of my stash. Erk. Note to self: label more consistently.
 Whoa. Silkworms that spin colored silk:   
 Blogged about creativity vs. destruction & tiny crocheted tawashi:  
 Must go now and be crafty. I command thee, Self! ;)
  Yeah ... It's much funnier now that that and the obscenely loud music don't happen every other day. Whew. ;)
  Ha, ha — yeah, we had giant steel drums being used as portable furniture a couple months ago.
  At least figuring out what the heck could make some of those noises was like playing detective. ;)
  I know exactly what you mean re: mind-boggling noise. Luckily my neighbors have gotten mysteriously quiet lately...
 In this week's  post, I talk about doing a teeny bit more than I did before:   What'd you craft this week?
 So now that I have conferred with  we are happy to announce that the giveaway winner is Silvina Leonnetti! Woohoo!
 Just DMed  with the winner of the giveaway. ;D Announcement Very Soon!
  It's tiiiime to draw the winner of the giveaway! ;D Gonna go look at the spreadsheet and generate a random number!
 Ha, ha — am using the exact time from  to time the drawing of a winner in the giveaway with  
 I think I'll do a study of disagreeable behavior on Ravelry's Random Acts of Kindness forum. Disagreeable RAKers seem a bit contradictory.
  Thankee, as always, for the RT. ;D And now back to poking at last-second giveaway wrap-up stuffs!
 < 2 hrs till  and I get to see who wins the mini shawl pin + hand-sewn pouch. ;D You can still enter: 
 RT  I love how fashion can make a person feel wearing/looking at it, I hate how it often make… (cont) 
 (And as a bonus, there's a cute idea with the story for how to creatively upcycle odds and ends that some people would throw out. :))
 I like this little story of someone who defied a discouraging teacher — even though it was later in life:  
 I love mini paper punches. Forgot how much until I found my Teeny Tiny Cassette Punch. Tiny paper confetti things!! ;)
  If only there were less of a dearth of table in this house. ;) I could piece something together anyway. Or make scrappy napkins.
  What about one of those exercisey Babe spinning wheels instead? ;D Exercise AND fiber!
 A treasury telling a story of springtime weather:   & a painting that eerily matches the colors of my yarn! 
  The name is now enshrined on a sideways purple sticky note attached to my desktop's monitor. Poof!
  Ha, ha ... I need to write that name down. It seems pretty perfect. Seventies crap loom, TRANSFORM! Into less crap loom!
 Now I'm sure this is the reason I wanted a serger: super-stretchy seams on knits! Woooo!
  Pinoloomio almost sounds like a weird weaving product — ha! ;D Which I guess it kind of would be...
  Maybe I'll name it Pinocchio. Loomocchio?
  I want to trick it out — put heddle blocks on, replace bolts with screws, paint it. Make it a Real Loom.
  Ha, ha! Maybe we did have the same first non-plastic loom experience! ;) Mine was one of those seventies hobby looms.
 Need to go make something. But what?
  Woo, thanks for the RT! ;D
  My first non-plastic loom was so crappy that I thought *I* sucked at weaving for a long time. 
  Your crappy loaner loom has got to be better than my crappy first loom, right? It doesn't fall apart while weaving? ;)
  Yeah, it works amazingly well for that. If I had more pocket money it'd be in danger. ;)
 I admit it: I like that I can see in Etsy circles when my items get hearts or are in treasuries. I've found tons of new shops that way, too.
 Er, I meant super-easy projectS. You know, that plural thing. ;)
 I need suggestions for super-easy project to practice using my serger on. Completely-serger seamed projects would be cool. :D
 And I thought my sewing machine was loud. Are all sergers this loud?
 Anyone know of any Japan relief efforts yet in the crafting world?
  Hey, thanks a ton! ;D
  As always, madam, you rocketh. ;)
 Thanks to      for  mentions! ;D
 Just listed a bunch of handspun in the shop, woohoo! My favorite is rainbow organic wool: 
 Finished weaving the scarf that was on the Cricket. :D Man, it's all soft and drapey — good thing I can't keep it 'cause I used angora. ;)
 Must stop meandering around online and go do crafty stuffs. *drags self away*
  Like light speed. ;D
  Dood. That was fast. *unspecific reference to Etsy circles*
  Do the giveaway dance, doo doo doo doo ... *dance*
  I just discovered, though, that I can make e-mail visible in my Blogger profile from the profile itself. Tricksy. ;)
  Did you want e-mail enabled for the Blogger profile or the Google one? The Dashboard, etc., path takes me to my Google profile.
  Ha, ha ... See, you have that covered and I've got Ravelry, so it works! Woo!
  Coo! I putzed around in Blogger prefs for a little bit, but wasn't sure what exactly to turn on, so help would be super. :D
  Awesome. :D Glad to know people are still finding the giveaway!
  Welcome! :D & maybe you could point us clueless types toward how to enable e-mail, since off the top of my head? No idea. ;)
  We're south of Destin, but it's nice and cool without being actually chilly. Sun came out, too. Last night: thunder + rain.
  The fact that we live in Florida and wool is rarely used makes it slightly more tragic, too. Sniffle.
  It was totally an accident, but that doesn't make it safe to gift him with further non-machine-washable goodies. ;)
  A kind captain? Maybe ... or maybe just a primarily solutions-oriented one. ;)
  I consider the emotional pain he inflicts on himself for his sloppiness a fair enough punishment. ;)
  He hasn't discovered it yet; it was sticking out of the laundry pile. He'll probably be devastated when he finds out, but still.
 Groan. The first mate machine-washed a handspun, handwoven scarf I made him. Last year's casualty: a pair of socks. He's officially cut off.
  Yeah, I know what you mean. I was so there until I got this one for my birthday. (WHEW.)
 Dear camera: Hugs and kudos. You are the savior of my product photography.
  I think I will! Thanks for the vote in favor! ;D
 I love this tatted atom pendant:  Yay, geeky sciencey fibercraft!
 I made a sewing machine cover. *beam* Only took me ten years or so. 
 Off I go to browse some of my books with quick sewing projects in them ... before I psych myself out or get derailed! ;D
  I've had some that was meltingly soft — seriously like butter. Wonder how that would work out for you...
  Ohhh, yeah. I don't much like the guard hairs, either. I like obscenely non-guard-hairy llama and alpaca.
 *mumbles something about boxes of alpaca and llama fleeces waiting to be used*
  Oh, wow. I haven't heard of a camelid allergy before — but it had to happen to someone. Alas! I loves me some alpaca.
 Sewed a little funky spiral to see if the machine is running smoothly. Tentatively: It works. For now. ;) Now: Need a small sewing project.
  Just allergic to angora. I was hoping the tiny proportion would make it okay, but no dice! Any angora = itchy. Oh, well.
 Back to poking at the sewing machine! I'm obsessively following the manual after years of not. Just to see if it makes a difference.
  So tomorrow There Shall Be Pics Taken. And I can't keep this friggin' angora/silk recycled yarn shawl, either. 
  Love that lemony yarn you listed not too long ago. It is SO lemonade. ;)
  If I like them enough to want to keep them, someone else will probably like them, too, right? ;)
  They're all singles, not like the stuff I have listed already, but I think I'll list them anyway. ;D
  .... and create the Ultimate Bacon Super-Product, to Destroy the Universe!! Or something like that. ;)
  What? Better than bacon mints or bacon ice cream? ;)
 There's a bunch of handspun yarn in the craft show inventory that never made it into the Etsy shop. Should I list it or use it? Hmm...
 Who out there wears head scarves, and why? I like to wear triangle ones to keep my hair out of my face while cleaning. Woo, Cinderella. ;)
 Just bought some old seventies crochet booklets, including one with hairpin lace in it. Woohoo. $3 destash FTW.
 Cool — a guinea feather necklace! Guineas: the birds that look like flattened beach balls when sitting. 
  Party in the house! Crafts for everyone this month! Or something.
 Oh, it's National Craft Month. Anyone doing anything awesome for it?
 My first piece of mail art to go out into the world in years is now in an envie and ready to mail. *anticipation*
 Catching up with new follower notifications now ... I've been a bad girl. A fairly decent pirate, though.
 Oh, and if you missed it, the giveaway for a mini star shawl pin + a hand-sewn pouch from  is still open! 
  Love the name "Princess Sparkle Pony." Ha. Makes me want my Fashion Star FIllies & My Little Ponies back.
 Play "spot the Star Wars reference" + help me figure out what these mystery scissors are for:  
 I should totally credit that link to Debby, but I suddenly can't remember what her Twitter name is. 
 Coming to you from your neighborhood fiber pirate: A horse named Arrrrr, and an announcer who loves it: 
  You're very welcome. ;D
  Your cute knits are also appreciated. ;) Looking forward to the next.
  My vote is for a knit dinosaur or UFO!
 Just came across this glass spinning wheel again. If you haven't seen it, you should. A spinning wheel. Made of glass.
