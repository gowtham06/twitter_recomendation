  Cheers for the shout out!
  Definitely - from what I've seen, I like the contrast between the sheer beauty & the cloudiness & moodiness; lucky you - Scott
  Yeah, give it a little more time. Admittedly sonically it's not my usual thing; the emotion and lyrics are genuine - Scott
 Though like chalk and cheese in comparison, I've been addicted to The National & Pulp for the past 2 weeks.  'Guest Room' -Scott
   3-way call - I like it! I'll hold out for 'Come Share The View' - not much chance though, I don't think - you?
   'Papillion', 'Fingers In The Factories' are my suggestions; you need to call me if they do Come Share The View!
  It took me a while  myself - but their raw emotion and lyrical honesty is quite beautiful once you get beyond the singles, imo.
   In 2 days? Wow, that crept up quickly. Please post the set-list!! - scott
 For something a little different, I've decided to do on an acoustic cover of 'Fake Plastic Trees' by  - will post soon! - Scott
