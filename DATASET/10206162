  What's Manuscript Tracker?
   I just don't see any other option.
  Exactly. Same problem w/ the Franco Blood Meridian/Sound & the Fury projects. Can you imagine an Oscars 2013 w/ all 3 of those up?
  Wait: That's a thing that's really happening? That sounds awful.
  Right! You can just try out killing your babies, see if you miss them. (This metaphor works less well here...)
  But of course I so rarely actually go back versions of a sentence. (It also makes it visually obvious I'm been working!)
  Right. I often use it to encourage more serious rewrites: It's very safe feeling, as if I could get the whole thing back.
  Found the tool recently, and also I don't use track changes every day. Depends what I'm doing.

 Third draft progress: Rewrote from 8-12:30. 334 insertions, 257 deletions, 11 formatting changes. Tree of Life soundtrack. The Antlers.
  I wish they'd use smaller ones. 10.8 Domestic Shorthair is going to be awesome.
  Already done and back to work.
  I won't switch mid-book anyway-- I don't want it to suddenly look different. (This has kept me from buying computers in the past.)
  Pages cannot import them correctly, especially regarding spacing before lines (as in starting a chapter halfway down the page).
  To be fair, I've never tried working with the Pages equivalent of styles. I just know I rely on them for manuscripts, and that...
  Definitely. There's other things I would never use it for. Even for fiction it drops the ball, at least for book-size manuscripts.
  For fiction writing, it's really close, but yeah, one or two features keeps me out.
  Too bad. If Pages didn't fumble my Word styles on import, I'd give it a shot.
  Haha. Auto-resume in Pages is nice. Doesn't work in Office.
  It moves horizontally!
    It's a very trackpad/multi-touch focus on the new features. Launchpad is less good w/ a trackball.
    Reversed the direction of my scroll wheel! Have to switch that back.
    So far so good. Dropbox synced up with no problem, which is my  critical app. Computer feels quicker.
    Just got back to my desktop.
  Nice. 30 minutes to go on my install. The download was surprisingly quick-- I expected it to take all morning.
   Well, it didn't take long to download at least. Installing now.
    I use Expose but not Spaces, so this might actually get me to use more of the functionality? Hard to say.
  Is that a new behavior, or do your scroll bars disappear in SL too? Because mine don't, unless I'm missing what you're referring to.
  I will hope for you that nothing moves horizontally.
  Of course, now that I've said that...
  Yeah, something's wrong when a poetry press goes under with 15K sellers. Sad.
  I have somewhat insane backup systems in place. But honestly, I've installed the last three OS upgrades Day One, without problem.
