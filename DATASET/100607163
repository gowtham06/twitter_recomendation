 We learn humility through accepting humiliations cheerfully.
 Love begins at home, and it is not how much we do, but how much love we put into what we do.
 It is in giving that we receive.
 Be approachable and welcoming, kindly and well-disposed. Open and large-heartedness.
 God has made us to be social creatures that need each other to be fully human. The solitary, isolated human being is a contradiction in...
 in terms.  Because we need one another, our natural tendency is to be cooperative and helpful.
 To be human is to belong.
 It is not what we do, but how much love we put into doing it
 To work without love is slavery.
 We can do no great things—only small things with great love
 Happy Valentine's Day!!
 Never let anyone come to you without coming away better and happier.
 Great to see the Olympics again!
 Everybody should see kindness in your face, in your eyes, in your smile, in your warm greeting,
 Intense love does not measure—it just gives.
 We cannot solve all the problems in the world, but let us never bring in the worst problem of all, and that is to destroy love.
 We must never be preoccupied with the future. There is no reason to be so.
 Thoughtfulness is the beginning of great sanctity.
 To all those who suffer and are lonely—give them always a happy smile—give them not only your ears but also your heart.
