 New blog post: 
  It's great that my brother is getting married... for him. It's wearing me out though. I won't stress you with details.
 Awww... I was hoping for another fillabuster.
  I guess that makes two of us. Nothing personal, Bucktown. Really. I have just had enough drama today to last a lifetime.
  It was a fair question. It was all the drama that followed that aggravated me.
    Thank God I wasn't here for it.
    Jesus fuck. I never want to check my Twitter feed and find so many pages of bullshit again.
    So please take my username out of this worthless flamewar before I get any dumber. Thanks.
     This is the dumbest shitstorm we have had since everyone thought their species was the best one.
    And you can have children and be married to a woman and still be gay. Her… (cont) 
      Jesus Fucking Christ! I don't know if he's gay, I was just quoting a coworker.
 18 days until moving day.
  Actually, they already did.
  Rape! That's a rape! YOU RAPED ME, YOU'RE A RAPER!
  I'd like to bend HER over a barrel and show her the fifty states.
  
  I know someone.
 It's the HENTAIMOBILE!
 This was parked outside of curch o.o 
 Rainbow Twizzlers! Omnomnom!
 Digging through all my old DMs. I used to be sooo affectionate o.o
 Somebody posted this really embarrassing picture of me falling for an obvious scam on the internet.
  :D *Squirms and snuggles*
    
  Mrawrf! *Flops on the ground and licks your face*
   My God! They dooo! *Whips out magnifying glass*
  Don't get all mopey. You're already on my super-exclusive favorites list.
 I should be able to remove my home timeline from Tweetdeck.
  Because she is into that kind of thing.
  I miss my friends D:
  that takes soooo long to do.
 I want to check Twitter, but I follow too many people that I just don't care about
 FUCKING RADIOHEAD, BITCHES!
  Doesn't mean he's not gay.
  what you said just there isn't any better.
 Neil Patrick Harris, Ian Mckellen, Vin Diesel, etc.
 They also complained about all of the actors they used to respect until they found they were gay.
 My coworkers asked me if I would kiss another man for one million dollars. If only they knew.
 Getting a grande tripple-shot vanilla cappucino.
 Movie theater trash is the rankest compound of villainous smell that ever offended nostril.
 I feel like Holden Caulfield.
 That concert was incredible.
 Crowd surfing to shoegaze music is like head banging to the philharmonic orchestra.
 This is the problem with free concerts. You get a bunch of stupid ass mainstreamers who don't know how to behave in an audience.
 Crowd surfing to shoegaze music makes you look like an ass.
 The girl next to me has definitely been smoking pot.
 It's a boring shoegaze group called The Entrance Band. Waiting for Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros.
 The opening act is so-so.
 We parked a mile away from the venue because my brothers are too cheap to spend 3 dollars on event parking.
 I am a Chimbley Sweep
  Though, the problem with this idea is that most level headed people don't want to be associated with parties.
  We could call it Philosofurs.
 Seeing Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros tonight :3
  check out what I just bought :b 
 I just bought this shirt: 
 Just bought Flowers for Algernon.
 Blog updated: 
  Yeah, it's some of my favorite lyrics by Crosby, Stills and Nash.
 Open up the gates of the church and let me out of here! Too many people have lied in the name of Christ for anyone to heed the call.
 Amateur film-makers make short films. Amateur editors make shitty AMVs.
 You got me running, going out of my mind. You've got me thinking I've been wasting my time. Don't bring me down, no no no no no!
 Apparently I listen to sad music :/
 I've been to the Oslo capital building. My dad grew up there. Terrorism is disgusting.
 I am SO in love, guys <3

 For starters, the new guy fits the part much better than Toby McGuire.
 The new Spiderman trailer is great.
 Jurassic Park 4, apparently. 
  o.o Well, give it to someone I know and have them take it to me at FC.
  I want it delivered to me.
  I'll join the fanclub before Furfright. I want me free hug. Even though I won't be at Furfright. You guaranteed it.
  Yeah, they're a real barrel of monkeys.
 Anybody else excited for Rifftrax Live?
  IT'S SHINY :U
  android.
 What's the best Twitter app?
 This is about one fourth of the people at the concert.
 The Decemberists still haven't taken stage. Probably because they have about 30 stringed instruments to tune.
 The opening act is awesome.
  Actually, I'm at a Decemberists concert.
 Waiting for the band.
 About to go to The Decemberists concert.
 I prefer my coffee iced.
 Armadildos!
 Reading a chapter of Catcher in the Rye, then bed. Seeing The Decemberists tomorrow :D
   
  Nyaasu :3 she did a full body picture and I cropped it.
  I call mine "bots".
  What do you call people who follow you that you don't follow back?
  What kind of things?
    I'm leaving the fandom and there's not a damn thing you can do about it! D:<
 I nicked myself shaving. That's it! I'm leaving the fandom!
  Everyone thinks I'm a girl at first :b this means you were one of my first followers!
    I was a  before  even existed.
 Ginger Ale is my favorite soda.
 The special effects in this movie make me feel old.
 Watching Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone. Cinematography has certainly evolved in the past 8 years.
  Michelle Bachmann is one of my least favorite human beings.
 *Perky ears, floppy ears, perky ears, floppy ears* :3
 Fruit flavored Tootsie Rolls are fantastic.
 My car stopped on the way to work <.<
  *Guitar solo*
  Nifty. Now stop crowding peoples feeds.
  Journey sucks ass and may be the most overrated band in history.  But that's not why I'm going to unfollow you.
 The most interesting thing about those tweets is that I'm not even watching the game.
 OOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLFDFVWUOFVEA! 
 GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOIOOOOOOOOOOOOO
 NEW AND EXCITING JOURNAL!  :U
 Michelle Bachmann is my least favorite candidate.
  First impressions are lasting impressions. Thank you.
 Thanks for the reassurance. I feel a lot better now.
 Do you guys like me?
 RT  Centipeding is having sex with a hundred people at once. 
 One of these days, I'm going to use the word "wizard" as an adjective.
 Every time I clean a filthy movie theater, an inch of my faith in human decency evaporates from the fiber of my consciousness.
  All of Harry Potter for the first time and The Hobbit for the third time.
 When I finish, it's back to fine literature. Specifically, I will be reading Dorian Gray.
 I know that looks like a lot, but I think it will be faster than last summers project, Les Miserables.
 My summer reading list - 
  If I'm too old for Harry Potter, I'm also too old for Doctor Who.
  Harry Potter transcends the boundaries of age far more than My Little Pony.
  Besides, the last two books I read were Platos "Republic" and Les Miserables. I deserve a break.
  In my defense, you're at least 9 years too old for My Little Pony.
 Maybe I should read Harry Potter :/ maybe then I'll understand all the hype.
 I told my manager about furries and he said "Whatever bloats your goat!"
 That might be the best cup of coffee I've ever had.
 I'm at the Nordstrom Cafe. I will never drink Starbucks again.
  That's not at the record store.
 At the record store. What CD should I get?
  The same.
 Larry King saw Harry Potter at our Cinemark yesterday. That's right. I ushered Larry King.
 Today, one of my coworkers asked me if I remembered the time the furries came into work. I laughed and said "Yeah, I was there..."
 I'm seeing The Decemberists next week and Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros the week after.
 I can scroll up and down on my phone with my tongue! 
  o.o What?
  *Adjusts my pipe* Elementary, my dear Kiniel.
  nickel I didn't have, I'd have every nickel.
  Denzel Washington!
  Really? That's why I play Second Life every chance I get!
  Except I didn't see part 1 and I haven't read any of the books since 4, so I probably won't see it anyhow <.<
  Well, I get to see it as many times as I want for free :b so there.
 Home from work, exhausted.
   That was forever and a half ago.
   o.o! WALK?!	*Runs in circles and scratches at the door*
 I enjoy watching celebrity interviews of people I respect.
 Just signed my lease agreement :3 It's official, I'm moving in with  August 18th.
 Which is better: Furry as a noun or as an adjective?
 I want a clever hashtag game.
 Advice from a true prodigy, people.
 RT  Everyone, no matter when people like  hate on your style, tell them to fuck off, and play your own way.
  You're cute, you know?
  Your content is the only thing worse than your grammar. Shutting up now. Goodnight.
  But I'm done arguing with you about it since clearly you don't really know what you're talking about. Goodnight.
  Most writers would disagree with your slogan, and you certainly don't live up to it.
  No, I'm a tasteful critic and you're a shit terrible grammarian. Do you call everyone who disagrees with you "closed minded"?
  Well, it certainly made no impact on my opinion. You make good points, but I disagree all the same.
  Who are you trying to convince, me or you? Goodnight.
  Like I said, I consider art to be expressive symbolism, for the sake of this argument. But you're right.
  Because it's unoriginal and amateur.
  I think we're on the same page.
  and technical writing is impressive, but if art is expressive symbolism, technical writing is hardly art. More like science.
  expressing interest in something you're enthusiastic about is dandy, but people need to be intelligent and tasteful about it.
  it's not so much fanfiction that that gets on my nerves as much is it is fandom in general.
  My problem with fanfiction is that it thinks itself so high, but most of the REAL writers are out making their OWN material.
  Yeah, I'm sure there are lower forms of literary art. Like the backs of shampoo bottles.
 Fanfiction is the lowest form of literary art. No exceptions.
  I bet :/ well, best of luck. Come visit home someday.
  So, if you don't mind me asking, what's waiting for you in Ohio? Why are you traveling?  
 I hate anime because every one of them is EXACTLY like this: 
  Black and white :D
 Being a furry long enough makes you an excellent liar.
  If I was a good artist, I would draw you for free.

  o_o hmmm... Force feeding? e.e
 In a perfect world, everything would be close together. Though, if the big bang hadn't happened, I guess I'd be out of a job. 
 Border collies are great at puzzles, because you take something scattered and you organize them into their rightful places.
  *Herd herd herd*
  Sheep, yes. Along with everything else.
 Herding. 
 The biggest hassle about being a border collie is that you have uncontrollable herding urges. It's like meth.
 Mars ain't the kind of place to herd your sheep. In fact, it's cold as hell. 
  I've never seen a picture of Kiniel o.o
  Well, my fursona is a regular border collie with one green eye and one blue eye. I spiced it up with cool clothing.
  of course I do :3
   gave this to me :3
    Clyde is Spumoni, because it's my favorite ice cream.
    I know. Kinky, right?
  *I'll* come up with the ice cream metaphors around these parts!
  Rainbow dash is Playdough ice cream. Eat her.
  I would feel terrible if I recommended something to you and you spent money on it and didn't like it <.<
  Besides, snow leopards are also cookies and cream! 
  It tastes a little more like chocolate than coffee :9 It's very delicious.
  Clyde could outrun anybody.
  :3 Good luck outrunning an agility dog!
  Mocha Almond Fudge, because... frankly that's just what they remind me of o.o
  You bet I taste good.
 Or maybe border collies are like cookies and mint ice cream because it's the best ice cream?
 Border collies are cookies and cream because they're... uh... they're both black and white, I guess.  
 Wolves are like vanilla ice cream, foxes are like french vanilla ice cream. They're both... um... really common ice creams. 
  o///o *squirms and wags*
 Pretty dang close to 600 followers, which is significant considering I never whore myself out.
 I know I only get minimum wage, but free movies, popcorn, soda and slurpees make up for it.
 I get free Slurpees every day at my job. 7/11 is no big deal for me.
  Cuuuute! Thank you!
  Yeah :D *Squirms* Thank you.
   :D :D :D
  I wanna add you! D:

  Right now I have some chamomile, lightly sweetened with a bit of lemon juice.
  My VERY favorite tea is the peach raspberry they serve at Olive Garden. I also like black strawberry iced from Seattle's Best.
  Black, Green, Chamomile, Chai, Half-and-half, Peppermint, Sleepytime, English Breakfast, Passion, etc. etc. etc.
 I FUCKING LOVE TEA! :D

 My life lately: 
  I know a black and pink border collie :b So there.
   Oooooh, that's really neat :o The only way it could possibly be better is if the tuxedo was black.
  Then you'll have to hear it from a border collie ;3 black and white are definitely classy colors.
  Black and white are classy. Ask anyone who owns a tuxedo.
  Border collies have the perfect number of tails D:<

  No! Go to bed! You're waking up bright and early tomorrow to go suiting!
 Mosquitos are the lowest form of life and God loves them least.

  I said I understood, not agreed.
  Same goes for every gender/species/plant/whateverthefuck. But I do understand your input :3
  :/ Well, regardless of your orientation, you still are either attracted to men, or you aren't.
  Maybe this isn't even an issue outside of Utah. But the general population feels they have methods of "Straightening you out".
 I don't think a heterosexual could comprehend what it's like to be attracted to the same sex, and I doubt one could advise me accordingly.

  regardless, the low quality of another persons socks is indeed a stupid reason to dislike them.
  Because you can argue that some socks are higher quality than other socks. The quality of socks, like music, is  semi-objective
  Though, there is nothing wrong with openly disliking someones socks, or thinking your socks are undeniably better.
 Jesus... Being an adult sucks balls.

 Why would anybody want to be a functional human being when they could suffer from some kind of social species identity dysphoria?
 Thank GOD that didn't happen.
 In fact, I possibly would have had very little reason to go to furmeets. I might have progressed into a rational, functional human being.
 I just realized, if it weren't for Twitter I would have never gone to FC this year o.o
  I refuse to believe it D:<
  Back then there can't have been more than 100 furries on Twitter...
  Then Scott and Lunari come by and ruin everything :U now 552 people have decided to watch me pretend to be an animal on the web.

  Every time the movie Little Secrets airs on television I get paid. This time, I was paid $500.
 Getting paid 500 dollars for something you did 10 years ago feels kind of like wining 500 dollars.
  got $500 dollars because a movie I acted in when I was 10 aired on basic cable.

 You can vacuum your own mess during shedding season. 
 These past 24 hours have been a roller coaster. 
 I guess I listen to a lot of really sad music.
 L-I-F-E-G-O-E-S-O-N, you've got more than money and sense, my friend. You've got heart, and you're going your own way.

 Working in a movie theater is lethal on a Friday night. I pray to survive Harry Potter weekend.

 Everyone should tell me their favorite bands.
 There is so much music to talk about, and so few people to talk about it with.
 The best album this year is easily Helplessness Blues by Fleet Foxes.
  He is a sexy, sexy man.
 In Rainbows is better than sex.
 Thom Yorke is a fucking genius.
 Now listening to my favorite band, Radiohead.
 Bought the newest CD by Crocodiles.
 It would surround 4 characters, each season would tell the same story from a different perspective with one finale to wrap them together.
 If I had the resources, I would start an internet sitcom about furries, made specifically for furries.
  Do you know who got Jimmer Fredet?
 There is objectivity in art, and it is not snooty of me to say so.

 I prefer my coffee iced.
 Armadildos!
 Reading a chapter of Catcher in the Rye, then bed. Seeing The Decemberists tomorrow :D
   
  Nyaasu :3 she did a full body picture and I cropped it.
  I call mine "bots".
  What do you call people who follow you that you don't follow back?
  What kind of things?
    I'm leaving the fandom and there's not a damn thing you can do about it! D:<
 I nicked myself shaving. That's it! I'm leaving the fandom!
  Everyone thinks I'm a girl at first :b this means you were one of my first followers!
    I was a  before  even existed.
 Ginger Ale is my favorite soda.
 The special effects in this movie make me feel old.
 Watching Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone. Cinematography has certainly evolved in the past 8 years.
  Michelle Bachmann is one of my least favorite human beings.
 *Perky ears, floppy ears, perky ears, floppy ears* :3
 Fruit flavored Tootsie Rolls are fantastic.
 My car stopped on the way to work <.<
  *Guitar solo*
  Nifty. Now stop crowding peoples feeds.
  Journey sucks ass and may be the most overrated band in history.  But that's not why I'm going to unfollow you.
 The most interesting thing about those tweets is that I'm not even watching the game.
 OOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLFDFVWUOFVEA! 
 GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOIOOOOOOOOOOOOO
 NEW AND EXCITING JOURNAL!  :U
 Michelle Bachmann is my least favorite candidate.
  First impressions are lasting impressions. Thank you.
 Thanks for the reassurance. I feel a lot better now.
 Do you guys like me?
 RT  Centipeding is having sex with a hundred people at once. 
 One of these days, I'm going to use the word "wizard" as an adjective.
 Every time I clean a filthy movie theater, an inch of my faith in human decency evaporates from the fiber of my consciousness.
  All of Harry Potter for the first time and The Hobbit for the third time.
 When I finish, it's back to fine literature. Specifically, I will be reading Dorian Gray.
 I know that looks like a lot, but I think it will be faster than last summers project, Les Miserables.
 My summer reading list - 
  If I'm too old for Harry Potter, I'm also too old for Doctor Who.
  Harry Potter transcends the boundaries of age far more than My Little Pony.
  Besides, the last two books I read were Platos "Republic" and Les Miserables. I deserve a break.
  In my defense, you're at least 9 years too old for My Little Pony.
 Maybe I should read Harry Potter :/ maybe then I'll understand all the hype.
 I told my manager about furries and he said "Whatever bloats your goat!"
 That might be the best cup of coffee I've ever had.
 I'm at the Nordstrom Cafe. I will never drink Starbucks again.
  That's not at the record store.
 At the record store. What CD should I get?
  The same.
 Larry King saw Harry Potter at our Cinemark yesterday. That's right. I ushered Larry King.
 Today, one of my coworkers asked me if I remembered the time the furries came into work. I laughed and said "Yeah, I was there..."
 I'm seeing The Decemberists next week and Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros the week after.
 I can scroll up and down on my phone with my tongue! 
  o.o What?
  *Adjusts my pipe* Elementary, my dear Kiniel.
  nickel I didn't have, I'd have every nickel.
  Denzel Washington!
  Really? That's why I play Second Life every chance I get!
  Except I didn't see part 1 and I haven't read any of the books since 4, so I probably won't see it anyhow <.<
  Well, I get to see it as many times as I want for free :b so there.
 Home from work, exhausted.
   That was forever and a half ago.
   o.o! WALK?!	*Runs in circles and scratches at the door*
 I enjoy watching celebrity interviews of people I respect.
 Just signed my lease agreement :3 It's official, I'm moving in with  August 18th.
 Which is better: Furry as a noun or as an adjective?
 I want a clever hashtag game.
 Advice from a true prodigy, people.
 RT  Everyone, no matter when people like  hate on your style, tell them to fuck off, and play your own way.
  You're cute, you know?
  Your content is the only thing worse than your grammar. Shutting up now. Goodnight.
  But I'm done arguing with you about it since clearly you don't really know what you're talking about. Goodnight.
  Most writers would disagree with your slogan, and you certainly don't live up to it.
  No, I'm a tasteful critic and you're a shit terrible grammarian. Do you call everyone who disagrees with you "closed minded"?
  Well, it certainly made no impact on my opinion. You make good points, but I disagree all the same.
  Who are you trying to convince, me or you? Goodnight.
  Like I said, I consider art to be expressive symbolism, for the sake of this argument. But you're right.
  Because it's unoriginal and amateur.
  I think we're on the same page.
  and technical writing is impressive, but if art is expressive symbolism, technical writing is hardly art. More like science.
  expressing interest in something you're enthusiastic about is dandy, but people need to be intelligent and tasteful about it.
  it's not so much fanfiction that that gets on my nerves as much is it is fandom in general.
  My problem with fanfiction is that it thinks itself so high, but most of the REAL writers are out making their OWN material.
  Yeah, I'm sure there are lower forms of literary art. Like the backs of shampoo bottles.
 Fanfiction is the lowest form of literary art. No exceptions.
  I bet :/ well, best of luck. Come visit home someday.
  So, if you don't mind me asking, what's waiting for you in Ohio? Why are you traveling?  
 I hate anime because every one of them is EXACTLY like this: 
  Black and white :D
 Being a furry long enough makes you an excellent liar.
  If I was a good artist, I would draw you for free.
  o///o
  o_o hmmm... Force feeding? e.e
 In a perfect world, everything would be close together. Though, if the big bang hadn't happened, I guess I'd be out of a job. 
 Border collies are great at puzzles, because you take something scattered and you organize them into their rightful places.
  *Herd herd herd*
  Sheep, yes. Along with everything else.
 Herding. 
 The biggest hassle about being a border collie is that you have uncontrollable herding urges. It's like meth.
 Mars ain't the kind of place to herd your sheep. In fact, it's cold as hell. 
  I've never seen a picture of Kiniel o.o
  Well, my fursona is a regular border collie with one green eye and one blue eye. I spiced it up with cool clothing.
  of course I do :3
   gave this to me :3
    Clyde is Spumoni, because it's my favorite ice cream.
    I know. Kinky, right?
  *I'll* come up with the ice cream metaphors around these parts!
  Rainbow dash is Playdough ice cream. Eat her.
  I would feel terrible if I recommended something to you and you spent money on it and didn't like it <.<
  Besides, snow leopards are also cookies and cream! 
  It tastes a little more like chocolate than coffee :9 It's very delicious.
  Clyde could outrun anybody.
  :3 Good luck outrunning an agility dog!
  Mocha Almond Fudge, because... frankly that's just what they remind me of o.o
  You bet I taste good.
 Or maybe border collies are like cookies and mint ice cream because it's the best ice cream?
 Border collies are cookies and cream because they're... uh... they're both black and white, I guess.  
 Wolves are like vanilla ice cream, foxes are like french vanilla ice cream. They're both... um... really common ice creams. 
  o///o *squirms and wags*
 Pretty dang close to 600 followers, which is significant considering I never whore myself out.
 I know I only get minimum wage, but free movies, popcorn, soda and slurpees make up for it.
 I get free Slurpees every day at my job. 7/11 is no big deal for me.
  Cuuuute! Thank you!
  Yeah :D *Squirms* Thank you.
   :D :D :D
  I wanna add you! D:
  -<<>>.+.<<>>-
  Right now I have some chamomile, lightly sweetened with a bit of lemon juice.
  My VERY favorite tea is the peach raspberry they serve at Olive Garden. I also like black strawberry iced from Seattle's Best.
  Black, Green, Chamomile, Chai, Half-and-half, Peppermint, Sleepytime, English Breakfast, Passion, etc. etc. etc.
 I FUCKING LOVE TEA! :D
 And those are my only 2 contributions to this trend.

 My life lately: 
  I know a black and pink border collie :b So there.
   Oooooh, that's really neat :o The only way it could possibly be better is if the tuxedo was black.
  Then you'll have to hear it from a border collie ;3 black and white are definitely classy colors.
  Black and white are classy. Ask anyone who owns a tuxedo.
  Border collies have the perfect number of tails D:<
 Border Collies > Your fursona :U

 I saw that Hot Topic got a new design, so I stepped in and, believe it or not, their apparel and design is even more tasteless than before!
 I CAN hug every cat.
  I warned you about that improv show!
 Waking up at 5 is unpleasant. Buying a shit ton of coffee.
  I'm going to bed.
  Why would I advertise for a group I'm not mildly associated with? 
  No. 
  I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about. 
  No! Go to bed! You're waking up bright and early tomorrow to go suiting!
 Mosquitos are the lowest form of life and God loves them least.
 That's us! We're the tail people! :U RT  Peeps in best buy with tails! Are they furries? Should I approach them?
  border collies don't pet. We snuggle. *Nuzzles*

   because he's a sweetheart and an amazing brother, and he's into weed and stuff.
   because he's one adorable S.O.B. and the most entertaining Twitterfur on my feed.
 Go  yourself.
   because he's a supafly mofo, and a legitimately awesome friend.
   because he's the best spottycat in the world, and all you other spottycats should be jealous.

 Everybody give  plenty of birthday humps!
 I would like to announce that  is a sweetheart :3
 I have so many musical suggestions that nobody will listen to if I listed them.
  Huh... No idea.
  What song are you looking for?
 Am I the only one here who thinks feeding trolls is actually kind of satisfying?
  Tell me about it :/ I'm not in the mood to do all this work.
 All of my music files are on my old computer >< I'll have to set it up again, transfer the files, and put it away.
 Faaaaantastic. My MP3 player had some hardware issues and now it needs to be hard-rebooted T.T
  i've been forgetting to eat lately for some reason o.o
 I just realized I haven't eaten today.
 *Shivers relentlessly*
 This break room is cold!!!
    o.o I am certainly popular today! *Snuggs*
 TIEM FOR GO TO WORK :U
  I said I understood, not agreed.
  Same goes for every gender/species/plant/whateverthefuck. But I do understand your input :3
  :/ Well, regardless of your orientation, you still are either attracted to men, or you aren't.
  Maybe this isn't even an issue outside of Utah. But the general population feels they have methods of "Straightening you out".
 I don't think a heterosexual could comprehend what it's like to be attracted to the same sex, and I doubt one could advise me accordingly.
 I miss the good ol' days, when I had Twitter-friends who would talk to me on Twitter :<

  How could you possibly lose an argument that Fox News is ridiculous?
 I got into a fight with my aunt about whether or not Fox News is ridiculous.
 Driving home in a massive thunderstorm. Scared shitless.
  People would dodge roll to class, because it's faster than walking.
 Spousal Abusers > Rapists > Murderers > YouTube Commentators.
 I bet My Little Pony will shift their marketing targets based on their unusual demographics.
 Heat exhaustion.
  no, but it's about time.
  what about meowstache?
  regardless, the low quality of another persons socks is indeed a stupid reason to dislike them.
  Because you can argue that some socks are higher quality than other socks. The quality of socks, like music, is  semi-objective
  Though, there is nothing wrong with openly disliking someones socks, or thinking your socks are undeniably better.
 Jesus... Being an adult sucks balls.
  people of less than reputable character.
  75% of my friends are furries. 90% of my friends who are profiligates are also furries.
  Profiligates.
  Most of mine are.
  Some of my closest friends are MLP connoisseurs.

    let's be grateful that it's of the less pornographic aspects of the fandom and let bygones be bygones.

 I feel overwhelmed.
  
 I apologize for that last tweet, slightly.
  I need an adult!

 That's Numberwang!

 That is my problem with most organized religion.
 The ideology that one exclusive template lifestyle will bring everyone happiness is like saying everyone should have the same shoe size.
 MOSES! 
  No, just the shitty top 40 ones.
 One of my aunts looks like a female David Mitchell.
 Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons!
 I always expect the bubbly tingling feeling I get when I think of myself as a border collie to  fade off, but it never does.
 If I were in a room full of sleepy border collies, I would be the sleepiest one.

  There's a guy at church who boasrs 100 followers on Twitter. I'd shove my numbers in his face, but he'd ask for my screen name.
 Why would anybody want to be a functional human being when they could suffer from some kind of social species identity dysphoria?
 Thank GOD that didn't happen.
 In fact, I possibly would have had very little reason to go to furmeets. I might have progressed into a rational, functional human being.
 I just realized, if it weren't for Twitter I would have never gone to FC this year o.o
  I refuse to believe it D:<
  Back then there can't have been more than 100 furries on Twitter...
  Then Scott and Lunari come by and ruin everything :U now 552 people have decided to watch me pretend to be an animal on the web.
  :/ This twitter account started as a moderately human-based social faculty between me and my 2 normal friends...
  Way to make me miss the good old days.
 RT  That hashtag tweet from before didn't get enough retweets. I'm leaving the fandom.  (cc:  ...
 RT  Furries: if you plan to display any adult-themed things in your homes, be sure to stock up on red picture frames.
  Every time the movie Little Secrets airs on television I get paid. This time, I was paid $500.
 Getting paid 500 dollars for something you did 10 years ago feels kind of like wining 500 dollars.
  got $500 dollars because a movie I acted in when I was 10 aired on basic cable.
 O_O! I just got a check from the Screen Actors Guild for $500!
  but make sure they know you're not being serious >.>
  tell them to suck a dick.
 Retweet if you believe in rock and roll!
 Funny how my older brother introduced me to music and now I introduce him to music.
  breath-taking.
  Lets not forget that their next project is DOTA 2.
 Radiohead.
 Again, that is.
 Now that people are getting back from AC, I should start posting tweets that people will actually care to read :b
 You can vacuum your own mess during shedding season. 
 These past 24 hours have been a roller coaster. 
 I guess I listen to a lot of really sad music.
 L-I-F-E-G-O-E-S-O-N, you've got more than money and sense, my friend. You've got heart, and you're going your own way. 
 The past 12 hours have been exasperating. I don't think I will be able to function properly for weeks ._.
 I feel physically and emotionally drained.
 Sometimes I'll be having a hard day, then I look at the tweets from my  and feel immediately better.
  I'm more worried about cleaning the theaters.
 Working in a movie theater is lethal on a Friday night. I pray to survive Harry Potter weekend.
 Please, nobody throw rocks at me, but Pibb > Dr Pepper.
  tell your cat that I feel the same way.
 Everyone should tell me their favorite bands.
 There is so much music to talk about, and so few people to talk about it with.
 The best album this year is easily Helplessness Blues by Fleet Foxes.
  He is a sexy, sexy man.
 In Rainbows is better than sex.
 Thom Yorke is a fucking genius.
 Now listening to my favorite band, Radiohead.
 Bought the newest CD by Crocodiles.
 It would surround 4 characters, each season would tell the same story from a different perspective with one finale to wrap them together.
 If I had the resources, I would start an internet sitcom about furries, made specifically for furries.
  Do you know who got Jimmer Fredet?
 There is objectivity in art, and it is not snooty of me to say so.
 I find it mysterious that  announced a travel related hiatus on the same week as Anthrocon. 
 I'm going to bed. Maybe I'll find a reason to feel like less of a terrible person tomorrow.
 I may seem pleasant, but I'm a real asshole when you get to know me. I'm sure certain people can vouch for that.
