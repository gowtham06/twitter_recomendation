  So sorry to hear about your granny Rachel
 Hi guys! Last night I took a pain pill and it was kind of weird. Good news is that my headache is finally gone.
  The last one I saw was a girl who ate toilet paper. I can't believe the girl hasn't had serious medical problems.
  what are the addictions this tine?
 Crazy weird medicine
  I'm sorry Allie. Since you are keeping your niece and nephew tomorrow, could you spend the night with your sister?
  welcome back
  sounds like a typical night on twitter
  Chyess, she does ;)
  yeah I read that lol
 Guess who took a pain pill and is a little loopy?
  what's been going on tonight
  are you still awake?
  It was just an expression
  Leigh you need to YouTube Great is Thy Faithfulness. It is a wonderful hymn
  That is such a fantastic hymn. My favorite is Because He Lives.
 Stupid criminals! Someone broke into my brother's car, but only got OTC meds & his swimsuit & towels, lol
  there are still some guys out there. We needed an outfielder big time. We didn't have to give up much either.
  Nope, nothing wrong with being proud of hard work that is also good.
  did you see where my Braves got Bourn?
  haha I like the way you said that
  Hope you guys have an awesome time of worship. I'm getting ready for church myself now.
  mornin' MB
 Good morning everyone
  Yes, they sell pop-tarts in bulk. We used to buy them for daycamp.
 I love that Sue Sylvester is on the Glee movie commercials. High-larious!
  That's awesome!
  She is pretty beast, love her voice

  Good Night Allie

  I have a reason for asking, but that's not important right now
  Also, what are your 2 favorite colors

  I know you are relieved and excited. Do you get a room or at least an office?
  HEy Allie somehow I missed your exciting news yesterday. Congratulations!!!
  I'm good, just kind of relaxing today
  Glad that you are home Kate
  I'm so sorry about your mom.Your family is in my prayers.
 Watching Top Gun, very hot men in this movie ROLL TIDE!
 Ahh, mission accomplished, clothes are sorted for charity
  good night Skippy
  glad you guys had so much fun
  so I take it NKOTB was a huge success
  now when you tweeted that the pizzookie popped into my head
  he is a cutie for sure
  I used to watch them every Saturday morning. Plus, NPH is in the movie
 Is anyone besides me excited about the new Smurfs movie?
  good night MB
   yep there might be blood shed for sure haha
   That may be the understatement of the year haha
  what? Already? It's only 11:41
  Yep!
  DM
  sort of, I wanted to be good, but it really hurt lol
 Watching The Proposal, how hot is Ryan Reynolds?
  it was one of those injuries where you want to cuss blue streak, so I just kept saying cuss word cuss word cuss word
  thanks, it already looks better
  yeah it feels really good
 Look what I did to my finger today with pliers  
  haha, thanks :)
  Hey Donna, what's going on w/mom? Been away most of the day
   I just know that I get away with more now that I'm blonde. (insert evil laugh here)
  Seriously, that is about the sweetest thing, thank you so much!
   Jumping in, as someone who went back to blonde, I have to say blonde is the best! lol
   I thought she would be, seems nice in the interviews I've seen
   I didn't pass out, but the fam was wondering which I was watching when I started cheering
  Ok, so I just jumped up and danced around my room lol
  MB this just proves you are the coolest ever!
  OMG!! That's stinking awesome!!!
  yes...
  Alright, lay it on me sister
  You always have good things
  Ok
  Hey MB what's up?
 Look who's sporting a diamond ring today  
  she's only 11 weeks so I hope I won't have to do that
 Good morning everyone. I'm down helping a pregnant friend in her classroom today.
   I'm still up Leigh
    haha, yeah he was certainly interesting
    I may need some help to get to the point where I will be willing to sing in front of people lol
    Is it me or would WWDD make the most perfect karaoke song
     Nothing, I was walking around Atlanta singing it lol
  It's like my obsession with watching Toddlers & Tiaras. I love that show.
  yeah, it's not good, but I can't stop watching. It's like the Toddlers & Tiaras show, horrible, yet I continue to watch
     MB, was humming it coming out of church, that's awesome!
 I really don't know why I'm watching, but I can't seem to turn the channel from CMT's Sweet Home Alabama.
  I think WWDD should be the next single. It's such a fun song, but I like everything you sing :)
  since you have an affinity for reality tv, have you seen the CMT show Sweet Home Alabama?
  I take it yall are already in Atlanta
  Glad you liked the flowers, Allie picked them out for us
  Yay! You got it!!!
  that's awesome Mel
 Boys trying to build a house of cards last night 
  I am feeling much better now. Just needed some meds and some caffeine
  I'm good, I've had a headache for most of the day, but it's starting to go away
  ouch, I'm sorry you are still hurting
  how are you feeling today Kate?
   Skippy you are hilarious
  camps are over, we had a little over night trip to Atlanta, but we are through for the summer now
  Hey Sandra, I was at church earlier
  yeah, I got in last night and went straight to bed
  just got on and saw about your grandfather, praying for you and your family
  good night Allie
  are you recording Kristin?
 White Water is fun. I made a kid go on a ride thus conquering his fear of tunnels and darkness
 Headed to White Water today.
 My view at Turner Field in Atlanta  
 I've been trying to tweet a pic from Turner Field, but it won't go through.
  Enjoying the game from sec 411. Came all the way from Tuscaloosa, AL to see the game
 Rain delay at the game  
  Braves game tonight and Whitewater tomorrow
 On our way to atlanta 
  Happy Birthday Mel!
  someone else may have already told u this, but fellow twitter fam member  has the same b'day as you.
  We ordered out from there last week & they messed up the order. Mom complained on the website & we got 2 free meals, we shared
  Church was good, I had to keep the nursery tonight. 3 people were able to eat a Cracker Barrel today for $10
  He's a pitcher for the Braves and just gave up a walk off home run and the Braves lost
 Linebrink you suck!!
 Neil Patrick Harris? Perhaps  
  a quiet house may be the best present they could have given you lol. I look forward to seeing Mitch's sermon
  Hey Leigh is your family spoiling you today?
  Happy Birthday Kristin! I hope you have a great day
 How funny is this, my mom left her car running throughout church this morning.
  Happy Birthday!
  Happy Birthday Leigh!!!
 I'm just no realizing That 70's Show is freaking hilarious.
 YES! Team USA beats Japan 8-4 great job ladies, way to rep

 Team USA softball is beast mode right now, keep it up girls,  is the best  
  Ashley Holcombe Bell,  Tide, 
  Yeah, it should be a lot of fun.
  I'm taking my kids to a Braves game and to Six Flags White Water which is a pretty cool water park

  I will come for a visit with or without toys, although toys are very fun hehe :D
  I'm doing well, just enjoyed my only full week at home this summer
  Good to have you back Mel
  I'm totally jealous of your time in the boat
  I haven't eaten everything yet, just had bbq and part of the caramel corn cobb
  It will be a while before I go off somewhere with them again lol
    Yeah everything was sooo good
 So today was a success in that I got a personal sized buttermilk pie and a caramel corn cob.
  good night Kate
  how are you feeling
  I'm still around
  :)
 Drove 1 1/2 hrs to an open air market and got some great BBQ. Thought of you 
  It's a town in AL that's known for it's peaches
  It's like an hour and a half
 I may have found hell on Earth. I'm going to Clanton with my parents.
  that's freaking awesome! I've got to see her live sometime.
 Ok, Dolly's mic sucks. It's too low for her mouth or the volume needs to be turned up.
  I did, thanks Darcy. It's being put on dvr as we speak
  that's what I'm hoping
 Just realized I missed Dolly on Leno
  Very jealous, I love Dolly. Enjoy your time at the bowl
  good night Allie

  tell her good luck from me please :D. I think some girls from Tuscaloosa are there auditioning as well.
   Don't know that I've heard a more true statement Skippy
 Of course as a self-proclaimed daddy's girl "Fathers and Daughters" gets me every time 
 How much do I love "WWDD" by  A real whole lot that's how much!!!
  yes, feeling a lot better, ate again today. So far so good
  It's ok little penguin, I'm gonna take you to the zoo. The people at the zoo are very nice. Lol
 Watching Sling Blade, I love this movie.
  Much better, kept me up a little last night, but feeling much better this morning
 Good morning all, didn't sleep well so I woke really late this morning.
  I'm trying to make it to your August 2nd show.
  Perhaps she needs some special treats to make her feel better.
  How are you doing? I hope things are going well for you.
  I'm going to Atlanta on Monday and Tuesday for a Braves game & White Water Park, then Nashville the next week
  yeah I have to report back on August 5th
  it's pretty good, just really busy
  Hi Donna, how are things with you?
  I'm still up
  good game tonight, way rep Bama! 
 The poor defense by the Czech Republic reminds me of watching a 10 and under game
  I saw your tweet about that. I bet it's hotter in NY than Tuscaloosa
  It's freaking hot
 Finally eating again, let's hope all goes well
 Watching World Cup Softball
  "Jealous of the Angles" by Jenn Bostic, "I Want Somebody" by Kristin Chenoweth
 Hello, how is everyone doing tonight? I've been battling a mild case of food poisoning since last night.
 Just in case anyone is wondering, the pecan pie cupcake at Gigi's ah-maz-ing!!!
  Sorry Kate, but something has pulled me away from Skype & it can't be helped
  Bought this for my brother tonight and thought about you  
 I got southern comfort (pecan pie), wedding cake, banana split, & white midnight mahic
  banana split
 Woohoo it was still open and they had a special, buy 3 get one free
 Please let Gigi's still be open!
 Getting my free queso from Moe's!!
  Do you hate all veggies or do you at least like corn, green beans etc?
 Been a busy and productive day for me today, I actually got several things accomplished
  don't forget that Moe's has free queso today
  yeah, I've just been kind of lurking on twitter. Good night Sandra.
  I'll think about it.
 Considering how bad my head is hurting I should go to sleep, but can't for some reason. Oh & now the inner problems again, yuck!
  You are a reflection of how great of a job your parents did in raising you.
  Ugh, I don't know about that
  Not the heat bc I haven't been outside today. Pretty sure it's sinus issues
 Ok, seriously this headache needs to go away. Eight hours is plenty of time for you to go away
  I'm glad Maddie is doing well. I know you can't wait to see her.
  thanks Skippy
  it's a few posts down
  My new hair
  good night Allie
  thanks MB
  Thanks Linda, I have to admit getting my hair is a guilty pleasure
  thanks Allie, I know I feel like I haven't talked to you in forever
 Got my hair did today  
  Yay, I'm glad she's doing well.
 Getting my hair did. I just love having people fix my hair. I wish I could be a celebrity just for the hair stylist lol
 I know a lot of you are saying that you can't see tweets and have lost followers and such, but I haven't. I can see all of you.
 So based on what I'm reading twitter is messed up
 I swear I must have a hearing problem or I'm just really talking softly bc everyone is asking me to repeat myself
 RT  Found out this morning that middle aged women driving Miatas while lighting cigarettes can nearly be as dangerous as texters ...
  poor little God-luv-it Maddie, saying prayers for her today.
  I'm taking the kids to see a Braves game and go to Six Flags White Water
  what do you have going on today?
  I've got to begin putting my Wed night lesson on power point & book a hotel for our Atl trip next week
  I think I have everything else now
  Thanks for the video MB
  I didn't get your email
   could you send me a copy of that video as well? I couldn't get it to download the other day
  When did the ringing start?
  Hopefully it will be gone by tomorrow
  I'm sorry, inner ear trouble sucks big time
  Are your ears still bothering you?
 YESSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!
 Horrible defense by the US
 GOAL!!!!!!!!
 Go USA soccer!!
  Our church just needed a few minor touch-ups
  we had a work day at church and I was painting the hallway
  Hi Kate! I miss you too. I spent the day painting.
 Painting, painting, and more painting. It's a Nehemiah day at church.
  military folks r so appreciative, best friend's hubby did 2 tours in Iraq & he was so thankful 4 anyone who supported them
  Well, Auburn is going to be terrible this year so Clemson should win
  it's just an easy trip for me. I can watch the Bama game somewhere and go to the Opry that night
  haha, one belongs to my brother bc it was his birthday yesterday
  I've just got to buy tickets now.
  I can't complain I have my choice of 3 Gigi's cupcakes in my kitchen right now.
  Yeah, we are only playing North Texas so it's a big game lol. I'm doing well. How are you Gary?
  Awesome! I'm so there!
  It is very very good. It is probably the best one yet.
  Is the Opry date for sure? I only 3 hrs away so I want to come even though it's a football game day.
  have you gotten a ticket?
  Not yet, I wanted to make sure it was confirmed
  Excited about heading 3 hrs north to hear u sing at the Opry in Sept, will probably be missing football to do it lol
 Ok, so Harry Potter was pretty stinking awesome
 Let the games begin, Harry Potter!
 That would be finally at the theater to see the final Harry Potter! Roll Tide
 Finally at the theater to the final Harry Potter.
  Whoa! Roll Tide! I'm so there

  yeah just watching a movie with the kids, what's up?
  I realize I'm behind, but congrats on the nomination. April Rhodes is a fantastic character!
 Happy Birthday to my little brother Eddie.
   Good morning ladies
  I love everything u sing bc it's awesome, but my vote for next single is WWDD
 Good morning everyone
 So in reading twitter, I guess everyone is upset with Buck bc there was no listening live. Is that about right?
  Allie, what's the link?
  You will be awesome!
  Blessings on your show tonight
 Home, had a great visit though
  woe is all I can say

 Getting cranked up for some soccer. Yes, you heard me correctly I said soccer.
   Absolutely!! Can't wait to see us kick some French butt!
 Harper says Riley wore me out yesterday!  
    Ok, just to set the record straight, she made me tweet about the oatmeal. (cont) 
  Around early afternoon, hoping to watch all of the soccer game first.
 Irony of the morning, Laurie fixed me the last packet of oatmeal. The irony is she didn't use enough water & cooked it too long.
  what are the call letters for the PC station
  Can you post the Jackson link?
  no I'm going home tomorrow
 It's not even 11 and I can't keep my eyes open.
  oh it's not my doll, it belongs to my friend here in Nashville. She's from Mississippi so that should explain a lot lol
 Riley is loving the pillow, while Harper is confused about he's doing  
  why are saying haaalllleluyar?
  which is another name for yummy goodness
   neither just means it was funny lol
   Sorry I had to go to the bathroom after reading your last tweet
  it's a doll that we discovered in Tennessee
  it's called Biga-Baby. "Hi, my name's Biga-Baby. Wanna play?" (insert Chuckie voice) 
 Creepy doll anyone?  
 This was a meat & 3, fried chicken, Mac & cheese, mashed potatoes & gravy,  fried okra w/an extra bowl of brown gravy  
   How about eating Dotson's today? It's a meat and three place
  let hot roll Annie's hair, this is the result   
   It's a frozen yogurt place in Nashville
 Bed bus is here, must get on board. Annie and I are doing hair and make-up tomorrow.
  Laurie said that Darcy is the, "mo-bile" geography Nazi
   It's her birthday and we are out celebrating right now. We are at Pinkberry, then off some Irish Pub.
    No candles are for tomorrow.
   and myself at Pinkberry. Happy Birthday Darcy!
 First time at Pinkberry with  and  It's very yummy, salted caramel
  my pleasure, looking forward to hearing you live again
 On my way to Nashville listening to 
  Yep we are going to celebrate Darcy's b'day
  It's up to you bc it's your b'day.
  Me too, what are we doing tonight?
 Happy Birthday  Hope it's a great day Darcy!
 YES!! It's finally raining in Tuscaloosa
  yep, I'm with y'all this time. I call Hope as my cuddle buddy
   Tomorrow morning, should be in by like noon or so
 USA USA USA USA USA !!!!
 I don't like soccer, but this is ridiculous!!
  Bunch of big fat fakers
  Yeah, I'm coming. What do you want to do for your b'day?
 Gah, Brazil that is bush league!
  I'm sure you look beautiful as always
  So sorry for your loss. You and your family are in my prayers.
  Are you the type of aunt that likes to "spoil" the kids? Those are the best lol
    Aww, me too! I love that place. Have a burger for me please ;)
  oh yeah, just glad to be home
  have you ever had Yogurt Mountain? It's very yummy
  I'm home :)
  what happened?
  oh yeah, it was a very good experience, beautiful place
  they are fine, everything checked out fine with Zach
  Heather got food poisoning and big Zach had chest pains
 Finally home from camp, it was a good experience. Now getting some much needed food
   Ang Ang Ang
  thanks Leigh
  I'm not adjusted either lol. It's still an hour too early.
 Last morning of camp, it's been a great experience.
  oh it was definitely worse, this was after one of them had packed up
  We will thanks Linda.
 Want to know what a room with 3 teenage girls looks like?  
  We are actually going home through Knoxville.
  They told us black bears here. We don't don't have grizzlies in Alabama. An occasional black bear, but not many
  Yeah, even though it's been a little drama filled & had sick kids it was a good week.
  Funny u should mention bears bc one of the 1st pieces of info I got here was that bears had been spotted on campus, 1 last night
  we head home tomorrow about mid-morning.
  I'm currently waiting in an insanely long line for popcorn and coke
  no, it's night life right now
  Not camp food, we traced it to Taco Bell
  one had food poisoning and the other had chest pain. 1 with chest pain is fine & food poisoning will be better by tomorrow.
 Hello twitter fam, been away from twitter a lot this week bc of camp. 2 went to the ER this morning, not a trip w/out a hospital visit
  thanks Linda, it's a nice cool morning here on the mountain
 Hanging out in downtown Asheville, North Carolina. It's pretty neat, kinda like the Paseo in OKC.
 It's a small world, just met a girl from DC who came to Alabama as a tornado relief volunteer.
  haha, have fun. I'll be glad to get back to central time so everything will be on time again.
  Hey MB, I'm just hanging out at Rec rally right now. Kids have been doing team building and games
 Good morning everyone.
 2 of my girls  and  are so small they both fit in this pair of sweatpants  
  it was a good show. I'm glad did it for the kids. Well, and for us adults too.
  did an awesome job with the fireworks tonight! Thanks bunches guys.
  y'all are probably getting the one we had earlier.
 Firework!  
  fireworks were great, here's a pic of them  
  thanks for the affirmation Allie
  It's in the mountains of North Carolina. Eastern time is trying to kill me. Everything is an hour earlier than it should be.
  we have Bible study, games, some are doing a painting course, one is learning percussion. They also do team building too
 Misty clouds around the mountain  
  thanks, I'm sure I will
  We are here until Friday.
  I'm good just enjoying our first full day of camp.
    I hear ya it's mine too
  Listen to some  perhaps her first album Let Yourself Go. Very peppy & very good music which should wake you up :)
  Awesome that makes me very happy.
  Welcome home Coach! Great to have you back at Bama.
  Camp is going well so far. If we can just keep the rain away during outside activities
  Thanks we will, just hope the rain will move on though here.
   Yep we are at Fuge and it's great. First time to Fuge at Ridgecrest. Definitely beautiful here.
 Storm is moving in on the mountain   
 Want to share a shot of the local foliage here  
  I love it here. It's a cooler temperature as well.
  Good morning! Greetings from beautiful Ridgecrest Conference Center in North Carolina.  
 Just hiked Mt. Kilimanjaro to get to the place for recreation.
  morning Skippy
  oh they are already up, we are already in the auditorium for opening assembly
 View from yesterday when we were driving in and the view from the porch this morning   
 Good morning everyone. If it wasn't so beautiful here I would be upset about being up so early.
  thanks it's beautiful here, mist covering the mountains
  With central you gain an hour
  I was up at 5am central time. That's what killing.
 Wow this Eastern time is going to be the death of me.
 Day 1 is in the books and boy am I tired. I hope you all had a great holiday.
 The definition of feeling like you've been hit by a train is Stephanie. Gah, I'm so tired & it's only Monday.
  That is some serious heat, but it's just a dry heat, right?
  thanks, the 2nd part is the best. Krazy Kookie dough ice cream, woohoo!
 Good morning everyone. I get to spend the day with my best friend & her son. We are going to a cave & a Blue Bell Ice Cream factory.
  good night MB

 White Water is fun. I made a kid go on a ride thus conquering his fear of tunnels and darkness
 Headed to White Water today.
 My view at Turner Field in Atlanta  
 I've been trying to tweet a pic from Turner Field, but it won't go through.
  Enjoying the game from sec 411. Came all the way from Tuscaloosa, AL to see the game
 Rain delay at the game  
  Braves game tonight and Whitewater tomorrow
 On our way to atlanta 
  Happy Birthday Mel!
  someone else may have already told u this, but fellow twitter fam member  has the same b'day as you.
  We ordered out from there last week & they messed up the order. Mom complained on the website & we got 2 free meals, we shared
  Church was good, I had to keep the nursery tonight. 3 people were able to eat a Cracker Barrel today for $10
  He's a pitcher for the Braves and just gave up a walk off home run and the Braves lost
 Linebrink you suck!!
 Neil Patrick Harris? Perhaps  
  a quiet house may be the best present they could have given you lol. I look forward to seeing Mitch's sermon
  Hey Leigh is your family spoiling you today?
  Happy Birthday Kristin! I hope you have a great day
 How funny is this, my mom left her car running throughout church this morning.
  Happy Birthday!
  Happy Birthday Leigh!!!

  It will be a while before I go off somewhere with them again lol
    Yeah everything was sooo good
 So today was a success in that I got a personal sized buttermilk pie and a caramel corn cob.
  good night Kate

  I'm still around
  :)
 Drove 1 1/2 hrs to an open air market and got some great BBQ. Thought of you 
  It's a town in AL that's known for it's peaches
  It's like an hour and a half
 I may have found hell on Earth. I'm going to Clanton with my parents.
  that's freaking awesome! I've got to see her live sometime.
 Ok, Dolly's mic sucks. It's too low for her mouth or the volume needs to be turned up.
  I did, thanks Darcy. It's being put on dvr as we speak
  that's what I'm hoping
 Just realized I missed Dolly on Leno
  Very jealous, I love Dolly. Enjoy your time at the bowl
  good night Allie

   Don't know that I've heard a more true statement Skippy
 Of course as a self-proclaimed daddy's girl "Fathers and Daughters" gets me every time 
 How much do I love "WWDD" by  A real whole lot that's how much!!!

 Watching Sling Blade, I love this movie.
  Much better, kept me up a little last night, but feeling much better this morning
 Good morning all, didn't sleep well so I woke really late this morning.
  I'm trying to make it to your August 2nd show.
  Perhaps she needs some special treats to make her feel better.
  How are you doing? I hope things are going well for you.
  I'm going to Atlanta on Monday and Tuesday for a Braves game & White Water Park, then Nashville the next week

  Hi Donna, how are things with you?

 The poor defense by the Czech Republic reminds me of watching a 10 and under game
  I saw your tweet about that. I bet it's hotter in NY than Tuscaloosa
  It's freaking hot
 Finally eating again, let's hope all goes well
 Watching World Cup Softball
  "Jealous of the Angles" by Jenn Bostic, "I Want Somebody" by Kristin Chenoweth
 Hello, how is everyone doing tonight? I've been battling a mild case of food poisoning since last night.
 Just in case anyone is wondering, the pecan pie cupcake at Gigi's ah-maz-ing!!!
  Sorry Kate, but something has pulled me away from Skype & it can't be helped
  Bought this for my brother tonight and thought about you  
 I got southern comfort (pecan pie), wedding cake, banana split, & white midnight mahic
  banana split
 Woohoo it was still open and they had a special, buy 3 get one free
 Please let Gigi's still be open!
 Getting my free queso from Moe's!!
  Do you hate all veggies or do you at least like corn, green beans etc?
 Been a busy and productive day for me today, I actually got several things accomplished
  don't forget that Moe's has free queso today
  yeah, I've just been kind of lurking on twitter. Good night Sandra.
  I'll think about it.
 Considering how bad my head is hurting I should go to sleep, but can't for some reason. Oh & now the inner problems again, yuck!
  You are a reflection of how great of a job your parents did in raising you.
  Ugh, I don't know about that
  Not the heat bc I haven't been outside today. Pretty sure it's sinus issues
 Ok, seriously this headache needs to go away. Eight hours is plenty of time for you to go away
  I'm glad Maddie is doing well. I know you can't wait to see her.
  thanks Skippy
  it's a few posts down
  My new hair
  good night Allie
  thanks MB
  Thanks Linda, I have to admit getting my hair is a guilty pleasure
  thanks Allie, I know I feel like I haven't talked to you in forever
 Got my hair did today  
  Yay, I'm glad she's doing well.
 Getting my hair did. I just love having people fix my hair. I wish I could be a celebrity just for the hair stylist lol
 I know a lot of you are saying that you can't see tweets and have lost followers and such, but I haven't. I can see all of you.
 So based on what I'm reading twitter is messed up
 I swear I must have a hearing problem or I'm just really talking softly bc everyone is asking me to repeat myself
 RT  Found out this morning that middle aged women driving Miatas while lighting cigarettes can nearly be as dangerous as texters ...
  poor little God-luv-it Maddie, saying prayers for her today.
  I'm taking the kids to see a Braves game and go to Six Flags White Water
  what do you have going on today?
  I've got to begin putting my Wed night lesson on power point & book a hotel for our Atl trip next week
  I think I have everything else now
  Thanks for the video MB
  I didn't get your email
   could you send me a copy of that video as well? I couldn't get it to download the other day
  When did the ringing start?
  Hopefully it will be gone by tomorrow
  I'm sorry, inner ear trouble sucks big time
  Are your ears still bothering you?
 YESSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!
 Horrible defense by the US
 GOAL!!!!!!!!
 Go USA soccer!!
  Our church just needed a few minor touch-ups
  we had a work day at church and I was painting the hallway
  Hi Kate! I miss you too. I spent the day painting.
 Painting, painting, and more painting. It's a Nehemiah day at church.
  military folks r so appreciative, best friend's hubby did 2 tours in Iraq & he was so thankful 4 anyone who supported them
  Well, Auburn is going to be terrible this year so Clemson should win
  it's just an easy trip for me. I can watch the Bama game somewhere and go to the Opry that night
  haha, one belongs to my brother bc it was his birthday yesterday
  I've just got to buy tickets now.
  I can't complain I have my choice of 3 Gigi's cupcakes in my kitchen right now.
  Yeah, we are only playing North Texas so it's a big game lol. I'm doing well. How are you Gary?
  Awesome! I'm so there!
  It is very very good. It is probably the best one yet.
  Is the Opry date for sure? I only 3 hrs away so I want to come even though it's a football game day.
  have you gotten a ticket?
  Not yet, I wanted to make sure it was confirmed
  Excited about heading 3 hrs north to hear u sing at the Opry in Sept, will probably be missing football to do it lol
 Ok, so Harry Potter was pretty stinking awesome
 Let the games begin, Harry Potter!
 That would be finally at the theater to see the final Harry Potter! Roll Tide
 Finally at the theater to the final Harry Potter.
  Whoa! Roll Tide! I'm so there

  yeah just watching a movie with the kids, what's up?
  I realize I'm behind, but congrats on the nomination. April Rhodes is a fantastic character!
 Happy Birthday to my little brother Eddie.
   Good morning ladies
  I love everything u sing bc it's awesome, but my vote for next single is WWDD
 Good morning everyone
 So in reading twitter, I guess everyone is upset with Buck bc there was no listening live. Is that about right?
  Allie, what's the link?
  You will be awesome!
  Blessings on your show tonight
 Home, had a great visit though

 Getting cranked up for some soccer. Yes, you heard me correctly I said soccer.
   Absolutely!! Can't wait to see us kick some French butt!
 Harper says Riley wore me out yesterday!  
    Ok, just to set the record straight, she made me tweet about the oatmeal. (cont) 
  Around early afternoon, hoping to watch all of the soccer game first.
 Irony of the morning, Laurie fixed me the last packet of oatmeal. The irony is she didn't use enough water & cooked it too long.
  what are the call letters for the PC station
  Can you post the Jackson link?
  no I'm going home tomorrow
 It's not even 11 and I can't keep my eyes open.
  oh it's not my doll, it belongs to my friend here in Nashville. She's from Mississippi so that should explain a lot lol
 Riley is loving the pillow, while Harper is confused about he's doing  
  why are saying haaalllleluyar?
  which is another name for yummy goodness
   neither just means it was funny lol
   Sorry I had to go to the bathroom after reading your last tweet
  it's a doll that we discovered in Tennessee
  it's called Biga-Baby. "Hi, my name's Biga-Baby. Wanna play?" (insert Chuckie voice) 
 Creepy doll anyone?  
 This was a meat & 3, fried chicken, Mac & cheese, mashed potatoes & gravy,  fried okra w/an extra bowl of brown gravy  
   How about eating Dotson's today? It's a meat and three place
  let hot roll Annie's hair, this is the result   
   It's a frozen yogurt place in Nashville
 Bed bus is here, must get on board. Annie and I are doing hair and make-up tomorrow.
  Laurie said that Darcy is the, "mo-bile" geography Nazi
   It's her birthday and we are out celebrating right now. We are at Pinkberry, then off some Irish Pub.
    No candles are for tomorrow.
   and myself at Pinkberry. Happy Birthday Darcy!
 First time at Pinkberry with  and  It's very yummy, salted caramel
  my pleasure, looking forward to hearing you live again
 On my way to Nashville listening to 
  Yep we are going to celebrate Darcy's b'day
  It's up to you bc it's your b'day.
  Me too, what are we doing tonight?
 Happy Birthday  Hope it's a great day Darcy!
 YES!! It's finally raining in Tuscaloosa
  yep, I'm with y'all this time. I call Hope as my cuddle buddy
   Tomorrow morning, should be in by like noon or so
 USA USA USA USA USA !!!!
 I don't like soccer, but this is ridiculous!!
  Bunch of big fat fakers
  Yeah, I'm coming. What do you want to do for your b'day?
 Gah, Brazil that is bush league!
  I'm sure you look beautiful as always
  So sorry for your loss. You and your family are in my prayers.
  Are you the type of aunt that likes to "spoil" the kids? Those are the best lol
    Aww, me too! I love that place. Have a burger for me please ;)
  oh yeah, just glad to be home
  have you ever had Yogurt Mountain? It's very yummy
  I'm home :)
  what happened?
  oh yeah, it was a very good experience, beautiful place
  they are fine, everything checked out fine with Zach
  Heather got food poisoning and big Zach had chest pains
 Finally home from camp, it was a good experience. Now getting some much needed food
   Ang Ang Ang
  thanks Leigh
  I'm not adjusted either lol. It's still an hour too early.
 Last morning of camp, it's been a great experience.
  oh it was definitely worse, this was after one of them had packed up
  We will thanks Linda.
 Want to know what a room with 3 teenage girls looks like?  
  We are actually going home through Knoxville.
  They told us black bears here. We don't don't have grizzlies in Alabama. An occasional black bear, but not many
  Yeah, even though it's been a little drama filled & had sick kids it was a good week.
  Funny u should mention bears bc one of the 1st pieces of info I got here was that bears had been spotted on campus, 1 last night
  we head home tomorrow about mid-morning.
  I'm currently waiting in an insanely long line for popcorn and coke
  no, it's night life right now
  Not camp food, we traced it to Taco Bell
  one had food poisoning and the other had chest pain. 1 with chest pain is fine & food poisoning will be better by tomorrow.
 Hello twitter fam, been away from twitter a lot this week bc of camp. 2 went to the ER this morning, not a trip w/out a hospital visit
  thanks Linda, it's a nice cool morning here on the mountain
 Hanging out in downtown Asheville, North Carolina. It's pretty neat, kinda like the Paseo in OKC.
 It's a small world, just met a girl from DC who came to Alabama as a tornado relief volunteer.
  haha, have fun. I'll be glad to get back to central time so everything will be on time again.
  Hey MB, I'm just hanging out at Rec rally right now. Kids have been doing team building and games
 Good morning everyone.
 2 of my girls  and  are so small they both fit in this pair of sweatpants  
  it was a good show. I'm glad did it for the kids. Well, and for us adults too.
  did an awesome job with the fireworks tonight! Thanks bunches guys.
  y'all are probably getting the one we had earlier.
 Firework!  
  fireworks were great, here's a pic of them  
  thanks for the affirmation Allie
  It's in the mountains of North Carolina. Eastern time is trying to kill me. Everything is an hour earlier than it should be.
  we have Bible study, games, some are doing a painting course, one is learning percussion. They also do team building too
 Misty clouds around the mountain  
  thanks, I'm sure I will
  We are here until Friday.
  I'm good just enjoying our first full day of camp.
    I hear ya it's mine too
  Listen to some  perhaps her first album Let Yourself Go. Very peppy & very good music which should wake you up :)
  Awesome that makes me very happy.
  Welcome home Coach! Great to have you back at Bama.
  Camp is going well so far. If we can just keep the rain away during outside activities
  Thanks we will, just hope the rain will move on though here.
   Yep we are at Fuge and it's great. First time to Fuge at Ridgecrest. Definitely beautiful here.
 Storm is moving in on the mountain   
 Want to share a shot of the local foliage here  
  I love it here. It's a cooler temperature as well.
  Good morning! Greetings from beautiful Ridgecrest Conference Center in North Carolina.  
 Just hiked Mt. Kilimanjaro to get to the place for recreation.
  morning Skippy
  have one for me
