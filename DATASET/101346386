 Here's a fun exercise: Look here:   Remove Harris and Favors. Then name me three guys you actually want on your team.
 But then I wonder, "is it a good idea for Amare to play with a real center? Or does a guy like Dalembert just get in Amare's way?"
 Reading  BtB, and he says the Kings could buy out Dalembert next month. I think, "that could work as a center to play with Amare."
  do we get to win a title or two with him as an important contributor?
 . But you understand my point, right? People saying "Melo's not that good!" and I'm saying "compared to whom? the elite 5 guys?"
 Yes, Dwyane is. You might be able to talk me into Paul and Howard. But is Carmelo really that far away from that? I don't agree with that.
 So, Carmelo isn't as good as LeBron or Kobe? Well, guess what? Neither is anyone else.
 I'm still befuddled as to why people are so down on Carmelo as a player. Yes, he is that good, if not quite the best player in the league.

 Also, if Melo wasn't going to stay anyway, Denver did pretty well. Saved money, got some young talent. Better than Toronto did with Bosh.
 For people criticizing Melo: do you think he's incapable of altering his game some? ie pass more, play better defense, etc
 Maybe they didn't have to give up that much. The future is uncertain, though. The present is certain. Right now Knicks have 2 great players
 I'm rushing to Twitter to announce I won't rush to judgement on this trade. No one knows who "wins" this right now.  No one.

 I'd rather the Knicks have tried Brewer out, but he'll get to prove his value more on a team that can actually play him the right way.

 So, Carmelo isn't as good as LeBron or Kobe? Well, guess what? Neither is anyone else.
 I'm still befuddled as to why people are so down on Carmelo as a player. Yes, he is that good, if not quite the best player in the league.

 Also, if Melo wasn't going to stay anyway, Denver did pretty well. Saved money, got some young talent. Better than Toronto did with Bosh.
 For people criticizing Melo: do you think he's incapable of altering his game some? ie pass more, play better defense, etc
 Maybe they didn't have to give up that much. The future is uncertain, though. The present is certain. Right now Knicks have 2 great players
